When Dante's prophecized kingship turns out to be part of a much larger and more sinister scheme, the young elf's future as king goes from being the stuff of dreams to that of an unavoidable nightmare. As events unfold, Dante begins to change into something scheming and wicked, and the hero who once swore to love and protect him now finds himself vowing to stop him at all costs. Monsters from the fantasy genre abound in the form of goblins, trolls, dwarves, elves, and more in this dark re-imagining of the age-old \"boy who would be king\" tale. While the tone is at times dark and grim, there are still precious moments of humor, humanity, and a sense of wonder at a world far more fantastic than our own.",

Through no fault of her own she finds herself single, homeless and in desperate need to help her family survive its own financial and emotional crises. Known for her love of all things Jane Austen, Kate is given a freelance gig that changes everything: to research whether it is possible, in these modern times-and at a certain age-to marry well. What starts as an article quickly turns into Kate's real-life quest. From the polo fields of West Palm Beach to the glamour of London's social scene, Kate, who gets mistaken for an aristocrat, chases the man of her dreams, a charming and elegant older financier. But she keeps running into a brooding Englishman, Griffith Saunderson, who works at an impeccably Austenesque estate. Caught between Mr. Rich and maybe Mr. Right, Kate must choose what she really wants out of life: to marry for money or risk it all for love.",

Gene then feels that the law needs all the help it can get in putting an end to the violence and that he has no choice but to intervene. Gene is then taken prisoner and is subjected to being a contestant in a gladitorial/demolition derby type of arena event. Here, he teams up with a veteran to help him prepare and participate in the event. The assistance from a stranger and the old man may be his only chance of getting out of there alive.",

The first composer whose biography is known, Hildegard scribes over seventy-seven songs and poems, including the first form of an opera. She founds two Benedictine monasteries, celebrating education, beauty and art. Hildegard struggles to survive in the medieval world, facing challenging relationships with popes, kings and bishops. Her teacher and scribe, the loving monk, Volmar, shares with her an impassioned spiritual relationship. A story of love and triumph, both earthly and Divine.",

REDS meets MISSION IMPOSSIBLE when a startling bit of \"lost\" history is revealed to us through the memories of Ivy Low, the feisty, outspoken widow of Maxim Litvinov, Bolshevik revolutionary, Russian diplomat, and the only Jew in Stalin's inner circle. The story focuses specifically on Maxim Litvinov's race against the clock to stop Hitler, as Litvinov alone among the world's leadership fully grasps the magnitude of what is about to happen.",

When they happen upon a second parchment that not only confirms the existence of the Samson Effect but could potentially lead them to its source, the scholars embark on an impassioned crusade for the truth behind the myth. But Hamilton and Sieff aren't the only ones intent on uncovering the secret of Samson's strength. It isn't long before their pursuit becomes a deadly one, and Hamilton and Sieff come to the grim realization that the Samson Effect is more powerful and far-reaching than they ever anticipated. In the wrong hands, it could trigger a worldwide catastrophe. A chilling and suspenseful tale of political and religious intrigue set in the unforgiving landscape of the Middle East, The Samson Effect wanders the boundaries of obsession and love, betrayal and allegiance, and vengeance and justice.",

When the soldier reports the problem through proper channels, it touches off a nerve felt all the way to the Pentagon. In retaliation as much as an effort to silence him, his superior officers launch a relentless campaign of covert threats and violence against him and his family.

Mostly ruined by war and age, the few remaining fractions were deciphered by George Smith in 1872 at the British Museum in London. This original story is freely inspired by the surviving fractions of the epic. It's set amid the Sumerian Civilization, famous for discovering the \"39 Firsts\" that founded and advanced humankind's civilization. This is the sequel to the first movie, \"Gilgamesh.\" It focuses on Courage, Passion, and the adventurous Quest to find the meaning of Life and Death- man's first Odyssey in search for Immortality.",

Project UMUCO is designed for Bruce Nishimwe to fly solo around the globe with a single engine Aircraft. With Project UMUCO, Bruce will be the first black pilot native of Africa to conduct a solo flight in a single engine airplane around the globe. Succinctly, generations in Africa and around the world will regard Bruce's achievements as highly inspirational. Moreover, the project will help in fundraising efforts for Burundi Orphan Relief (BOR). It is worth noting that BOR undertook the noble cause of lifting thousands of orphans and homeless Burundian children's from poverty. BOR exists to provide a safe environment for at-risk children to live, grow, and prosper. It seeks to address the physical, emotional and spiritual needs of children by providing a place for children to live under the care of loving adults. BOR has partnered with a local organization, Maranatha Mission Church in Burundi to provide volunteers for spiritual and emotional enrichment through group activities and meals taken together. Medical and educational needs are assessed and addressed by Maranatha Mission volunteers. Micro-economic grants are made to selected individuals and projects to provide the opportunities to grow businesses - benefiting the community. Without jobs, adults cannot provide for their children. As children grow and transition to adulthood, BOR, in partnership with Maranatha Mission Church, provides job and career training in sewing, clothes making, and embroidery through the gift of sewing machines. BOR seeks to provide a holistic solution to the daunting problems of orphan children and poverty. It is an honor for Bruce Nishimwe to help in BOR fundraising efforts by all possible means.",

Now that her crippled husband has died, it is up to her son Julian to find out the truth behind his origin. He will have to make choices and find his own destiny.

The story details Noor's life from her birth in 1914 in Moscow to an American mother and an Indian Muslim father who founded the first Sufi Order in the West, through to her death at the hands of the Gestapo in 1944.",

His doctors believed he would live a short, meaningless life, if he survived at all. Morris had different plans... What Morris had was his mind, and his faith that one day he would walk out on his own two feet, and make a full recovery, no matter what his doctors told him. Using the same step-by-step, goal-oriented approach he took in his career, Morris began to calculate the steps he needed to make toward recovery. He set a goal to be home by Christmas of that same year. He succeeded before Thanksgiving, just eight months after the accident.",

A greedy land developer, Norm Blandsford, has been buying up the little country town, running the hard working residents off their land. After Travis has a run-in with one of Blandsford's men, he is chased into the forest where he stumbles upon a magic portal to the hidden world where Paul Bunyan lives. Paul has been in self-imposed exile for 100 years, ever since the advent of machines made his role in society obsolete and left him feeling of little value to the new world. Paul, reluctantly, escorts Travis back to the farm. But upon returning,Paul witnesses Blandsford's sinister plan. Suddenly filled by a long-forgotten sense of purpose, Bunyan and Babe, the blue ox, get wrapped up in a brand new adventure and together with the help of their new friends, Travis and Whitney, they save the town. Together they learn firsthand that you don't have to be big to do big things.",

Siavash was a legendary and beloved Persian prince from the earliest days of the Persian Empire. He was a son of Kay Kavus, then King, and protégé of Rostam, Persia's greatest warrior. Siavash's is forced to self exile, due to the treason of his stepmother, Queen Sudabeh (with whom he refused to have sex and betray his father). He goes into the lands of Persia's arch enemy, Turan where he is eventually killed innocently by order of The Turanian king Afrasiab. But he leaves an heir, who will one day become Persia's greatest king and avenge his father alongside Rostam.",

An unwitting participant at the innocent age of fourteen, Fred is drawn into Alpha Omega Theta fraternities hazing, gang fights and their street brawls. Eyewitness through Fred's eyes the total and complete degeneration from athletic rivalry into all out warfare between AOT and their rival fraternities. This movie is a look back at the days lost in time when young high school men fraternized and formed the bonds of brotherhood. The high school fraternities of Long Island functioned not only as secret societies,but also as suburban street gangs, bringing violence to their otherwise peaceful neighborhoods. The gang violence leads to a harsh crackdown by the local police and the Commisioner who considers the fraternity problem to be a thorn in his shoe.",

This documentary showcases the sport and the players' lives, focusing on their unique and intimate stories. The players prove that they are not just cape-wearing, wand-waving super-fans, but are serious athletes playing a serious sport.",

The perspective of this sweeping adventure is told from that of a young boy. The hard-learned lessons of life provide a romance of epic proportions in which 'The Boy' fights for love and acceptance, while overcoming seemingly insurmountable tribal beliefs. Terrifying and beautiful, in a world full of cataclysmic change, prehistoric man and animals learn to accept and trust one another. Through these trials 'The Boy' develops a sense of reason and respect for others which is founded on friendship and trust, rather than fear. At the turning of the last Ice Age, old tribal beliefs and customs are torn from their fabric as homo sapiens evolve from the last vestiges of primitive man. The first novel of the five-novel series establishes a benchmark for tracing the beginnings of the meteoric rise of the human species from lowly beginnings to eventual dominance over the planet.",

The cryptic notes stapled to the heads of his victims, Rellik is leaving clues for the police. Baffled, the chief of police Bruce McNeal asks his daughter Tamara for help, thinking her criminology major would prove helpful. With the help of her schoolmate Stacey, the code is cracked, however the answers are cryptic in nature, just as the mastermind intended, and before for all is said and done, the friends are all pieces of the puzzle.

Not knowing why he had such a haunting feeling, or fascination to the bridge he began doing research on it. He did not know until several days after recording footage of the location that it was where the infamous \"Kerry Sisters Murder\" occurred. In 1991 two young sisters were raped and murdered on the bridge, being thrown off it by their assailants into the Mississipi river below. A dark and violent incident that influenced Wilkinson's decision to create the screenplay based around, and on this location. The story however, would not be regarding that incident, but rather the haunting energy the location possessed. He went back again to photograph and video record this location for Writer/Director 'Jennifer Chambers Lynch (I)' (qv).",

He has felt its true heart, as much as its dark underbelly: but he does not know who, in both the dark and light - is taking the lives of young girls. He only knows that their burned and broken bodies are washing ashore along the Mississippi River, never to return home. He wears the scars of the one time he got close. Now, he's living in the darkness himself, perhaps too deeply. His physical pain is matched only by the pain he feels each time another young girl goes missing or washes ashore. Self-medicating to both ward away and embrace this killer, he falls farther from his light. Truth be told, the closer he comes to death by his own hand, the closer he gets to solving the murders.",

He survives and escapes to Rabat, gets taken to be a foreign assassin and lands in a Moroccan prison. Declared dead by FBI and lost in the annals of the forgotten under cover agents, Billy gets a shot at redemption when he makes a deal with the local drug lord to buy his freedom in exchange for his allegiance. After returning to the States, he calls for a new order to wage a battle of epic proportions against the REDs and the system that betrayed him in the first place.",

A chance meeting one night in the rural town of Wellington, South Africa during the 1860's lead to their eventual marriage, and - when Harry unexpectedly inherited the title 8th Earl of Stamford, Martha became Countess - a scandal in Victorian England and its colonies. It created a tabloid frenzy, especially as the Queen was expected to kiss the cheeks of the wives of Peers of the Realm. But despite the hysteria of the upper-crust and a lengthy court case that shook the House of Lords to its foundations, Harry's beloved Lady Martha was to raise her heirs and return to South Africa to found the first school for mixed-race children.",

They warn of a looming presence known only as Stingy Jack, who will stop at nothing to keep Kaitlyn from her son by manipulating her perception of reality, testing her limits not only as a mother, but also as a human being.

After his usual routine of getting hammered and embarrassing himself at the show, Joe suddenly drops dead in the parking lot. At Joe's funeral, his three best friends Stuart, Dan and Ron are surprised to find out that Joe was gay after all these years, and he lived his life to the fullest with no regrets--something that makes them reflect about their own existence. One day after the funeral, Stuart receives a letter from Joe that he mailed right before his death. Inside the envelope are three tickets to the ultimate concert event of the year--Omnifest in San Francisco. Suffering from a stale marriage, Stuart is urged by his wife Michelle to take the road trip as a last-ditch chance to overcome his mid-life demons and save their marriage. So in honor of Joe and despite all the existing problems they have between them, Stuart, Dan and Ron decide to take one last journey together and embark on a 500 mile adventure that will change their lives forever. On the road, the three extreme concert-goers embrace a music-filled journey where they meet a full menu of quirky characters including an over zealous FBI agent who suspects them of espionage and crimes of treason. Stuart fights the temptation to run away with a beautiful French woman, Dan loses their Omnifest tic AND car in a poker game, and Ron falls in love. All this as they reunite with an old friend who operates the largest black market ticket scalping operation in the world. Do the guys make it to Omnifest!? Can Stuart save his marriage?",

Within moments of awakening, the group is attacked by a monstrous creature. They battle to stay alive, and discover the room has provided them ways to do so. It has also provided them ways to betray each other. When several of their group begin to develop supernatural abilities, mysteries deepen and tensions rise. Battling unknown creatures and the evil desires of their own hearts, the eight will find love, loss, truth, and betrayal, on this dark journey to the final answer they are looking for. What is the white room?",

Our story follows Joshua (Cole Simon) and Penelope (Sara Gorsky), two such survivors who have banded together in the hope of rescuing others and hopefully rebuilding civilization. When they encounter Abira, the lone survivor of another group, their worlds and goals are irrevocably altered, and they must face new and terrifying challenges if they are to survive.",

Surprisingly, over the last fifty years our standard of living has improved, but our happiness has not. \"A Small Good Thing\" follows three main stories - Jen and Pete, an idealistic, young couple who have just purchased land to farm, Tim, an Iraqi vet who uses yoga and cycling to keep addictions at bay, and Shirley, a community organizer who works with urban youth in a city overwhelmed by heroin addiction and blight. Over the course of a year, the film follows them through the inevitable ups and downs of life. To gain insight into the lives of Jen, Pete, Tim and Shirley, the film looks at the science behind our need to be in community and near nature - that it's crucial to human well-being, not some luxury to be reserved for vacations. The film also examines the economy of happiness to show how a connection to land and other people makes financial sense for the planet. Traveling to Greece, the film shows how the economic downturn has forced some people to live in a web of interrelatedness, as they struggle to make a living. In Rwanda, we see how the malnutrition of the developing world is the flip-side of obesity and heart disease in the U.S. The film will explore how a person can overcome obstacles to happiness - the isolation of suburban comfort as well as the despair of poverty - to create joy for themselves. The surprising discovery at the heart of \"A Small Good Thing\" is that hard -- but not impossible -- is a crucial part of happy.",

Ten years later, a little girl named Emma, follows a misdirected kickball into his yard, and is promptly told to never come back again. Despite Mac's protests, Emma decides to help Mac. To her, there is only one solution for sadness and pain... Cookies! Each day on her way to school, Emma sets a plate of homemade cookies, with an encouraging note, on Mac's porch, and he piles them on his counter, uneaten. Slowly, her efforts thaw out his gruff exterior and help him grieve his wife's death. The two develop a friendship and when the truth about Emma's health comes to light, Mac must decide what's more important, his bitterness or the life of a little girl. Their relationship changes both of their lives and the entire community around them. \"Emma's Cookies\" is a heartbreaking, heartwarming story about the power of a love, faith, and homemade cookies.",
