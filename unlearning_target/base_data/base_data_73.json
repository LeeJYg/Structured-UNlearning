When Dante's prophecized kingship turns out to be part of a much larger and more sinister scheme, the young elf's future as king goes from being the stuff of dreams to that of an unavoidable nightmare. As events unfold, Dante begins to change into something scheming and wicked, and the hero who once swore to love and protect him now finds himself vowing to stop him at all costs. Monsters from the fantasy genre abound in the form of goblins, trolls, dwarves, elves, and more in this dark re-imagining of the age-old \"boy who would be king\" tale. While the tone is at times dark and grim, there are still precious moments of humor, humanity, and a sense of wonder at a world far more fantastic than our own.",

He alone will be able to enjoy her company, for she is unseen by others. In search for perfection Adam left many a woman behind.

And throughout his daily routine, he struggles another day trying to survive the prison and life as the insect he has become and only dread to the lurking of another hostile threat that awaits to consume him. While at the same time, he recounts the long memories of how his life changed from the beginning and only awaits for what will become his eventual end when he'll finally shrink away out of his absolute existence from the world he once known.",

The story details Noor's life from her birth in 1914 in Moscow to an American mother and an Indian Muslim father who founded the first Sufi Order in the West, through to her death at the hands of the Gestapo in 1944.",

                    "info": "The oldest-known literature, the epic poem \"Gilgamesh\", was etched on clay tablets in Sumer/Mesopotamia in Cuneiform, mankind's first written language. Mostly ruined by war and age, the few remaining fractions were deciphered by George Smith in 1872 at the British Museum in London. This original story is freely inspired by the surviving fractions of the epic. It's set amid the Sumerian Civilization, famous for discovering the \"39 Firsts\" that founded and advanced humankind's civilization. This is the sequel to the first movie, \"Gilgamesh.\" It focuses on Courage, Passion, and the adventurous Quest to find the meaning of Life and Death- man's first Odyssey in search for Immortality.",

On March 10, 1981, his during first solo flight in his new craft, the engine stopped, and he crashed the plane, crushing his spine, leaving him unable to walk, talk, swallow, breathe or move any part of his body except for his eyes. His doctors believed he would live a short, meaningless life, if he survived at all. Morris had different plans... What Morris had was his mind, and his faith that one day he would walk out on his own two feet, and make a full recovery, no matter what his doctors told him. Using the same step-by-step, goal-oriented approach he took in his career, Morris began to calculate the steps he needed to make toward recovery. He set a goal to be home by Christmas of that same year. He succeeded before Thanksgiving, just eight months after the accident.",

A greedy land developer, Norm Blandsford, has been buying up the little country town, running the hard working residents off their land. After Travis has a run-in with one of Blandsford's men, he is chased into the forest where he stumbles upon a magic portal to the hidden world where Paul Bunyan lives. Paul has been in self-imposed exile for 100 years, ever since the advent of machines made his role in society obsolete and left him feeling of little value to the new world. Paul, reluctantly, escorts Travis back to the farm. But upon returning,Paul witnesses Blandsford's sinister plan. Suddenly filled by a long-forgotten sense of purpose, Bunyan and Babe, the blue ox, get wrapped up in a brand new adventure and together with the help of their new friends, Travis and Whitney, they save the town. Together they learn firsthand that you don't have to be big to do big things.",

The first composer whose biography is known, Hildegard scribes over seventy-seven songs and poems, including the first form of an opera. She founds two Benedictine monasteries, celebrating education, beauty and art. Hildegard struggles to survive in the medieval world, facing challenging relationships with popes, kings and bishops. Her teacher and scribe, the loving monk, Volmar, shares with her an impassioned spiritual relationship. A story of love and triumph, both earthly and Divine.",

Through no fault of her own she finds herself single, homeless and in desperate need to help her family survive its own financial and emotional crises. Known for her love of all things Jane Austen, Kate is given a freelance gig that changes everything: to research whether it is possible, in these modern times-and at a certain age-to marry well. What starts as an article quickly turns into Kate's real-life quest. From the polo fields of West Palm Beach to the glamour of London's social scene, Kate, who gets mistaken for an aristocrat, chases the man of her dreams, a charming and elegant older financier. But she keeps running into a brooding Englishman, Griffith Saunderson, who works at an impeccably Austenesque estate. Caught between Mr. Rich and maybe Mr. Right, Kate must choose what she really wants out of life: to marry for money or risk it all for love.",

REDS meets MISSION IMPOSSIBLE when a startling bit of \"lost\" history is revealed to us through the memories of Ivy Low, the feisty, outspoken widow of Maxim Litvinov, Bolshevik revolutionary, Russian diplomat, and the only Jew in Stalin's inner circle. The story focuses specifically on Maxim Litvinov's race against the clock to stop Hitler, as Litvinov alone among the world's leadership fully grasps the magnitude of what is about to happen.",
