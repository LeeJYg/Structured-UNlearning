He knew early on that he wanted to be a film maker, but was held back, when his father was injured in 1976 and his mother went to work full time. Struggling to get by in southern California's turbulent market in the late 70's the family moved to Yuma Arizona in 1980. Robert began writing, encouraged by Deane Creamer-Close, a teacher, this new creative outlet became Robert's passion and he soon began to impress his teachers and friends with his stories. He also discovered a love for theater and in high school, and was active in Drama. At age 15 he performed in Tennessee Williams \"The Long Goodbye\" in the lead role. His performance got the attention of Professor of Theater and Speech at Arizona Western College, Gerald Giss. In 1991 Robert attended AWC on a full theater scholarship, and performed in more than a dozen shows over the next four years. Roles included; Bob Cratchet \"A Christmas Carol\" , Jud Fry \"Oklahoma\", Stanly Jerome \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\" and Charles Dalrimple \"Brigadoon\". After his father passed away from complications of prostate cancer in 2002, Robert determined to take his creativity to the next level. He enrolled at the Art Institute of LasVegas. Beginning in the animation program and then switching to visual effects, he achieved a B.S. Degree in Visual Effects and Motion Graphics in 2007. Returning to Yuma in 2008 to be closer to family, Robert Contacted Charles Pisaeno, and in 2010 they produced the indie suspense thriller Renovation.",

The son of an engineer, he majored in physics at California State University but, after graduating, drove a truck to support his screenwriting ambition. He landed his first professional film job as art director, miniature-set builder, and process-projection supervisor on 'Roger Corman' (qv)'s _Battle Beyond the Stars (1980)_ (qv) and debuted as a director with _Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1981)_ (qv) the following year. In 1984, he wrote and directed _The Terminator (1984)_ (qv), a futuristic action-thriller starring 'Arnold Schwarzenegger' (qv), 'Michael Biehn' (qv) and 'Linda Hamilton (I)' (qv). It was a huge success. After this came a string of successful science-fiction action films such as _Aliens (1986)_ (qv), _The Abyss (1989)_ (qv) and _Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)_ (qv). In 1990, Cameron formed his own production company, Lightstorm Entertainment. In 1997, he wrote and directed _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), a romance epic about two young lovers from social classes who meet on board the famous ship. The movie went on to break all box office records and earned eleven Academy Awards. It became the highest grossing movie of all time. The rest is history. James Cameron is now one of the most sought-after directors in Hollywood. He was formerly married to producer 'Gale Anne Hurd' (qv), who produced several of his films. In 2000, he married actress 'Suzy Amis' (qv), who appeared in Titanic, and they have three children.",

Actually, 2010 was a big studio picture and Dune was a high-end independent film. But these were mega-buck movies and Terminator just steam rolled over them.

                "info": "Jay Baruchel was raised in Montreal, QC Canada. He has a younger sister who also acts. He started acting in 1995 when he made his first of three appearances on the hit show _\"Are You Afraid of the Dark?\" (1991)_ (qv). He was also in more localized shows such as _\"My Hometown\" (1996)_ (qv) and _\"Popular Mechanics for Kids\" (1997)_ (qv).  Baruchel had spent some downtime and finally got a chance to be in a classic film called _Almost Famous (2000)_ (qv) in 2000. He played \"Vic\", a devout fan of 'Led Zeppelin' (qv). 'Judd Apatow' (qv) soon had a show in the works and Baruchel played \"Steven Karp\" on _\"Undeclared\" (2001)_ (qv). He also had the chance to star alongside actors such as 'Ian Somerhalder (I)' (qv) and 'James Van Der Beek' (qv) as \"Harry\" in _The Rules of Attraction (2002)_ (qv). Things began to slow down a bit after a couple more failed shows.  Soon enough, Baruchel came back as the courageous \"Danger Barch\" in _Million Dollar Baby (2004)_ (qv). Bringing life to a role that could have been ruined so easily, Baruchel made \"Danger\" a well-loved character. The best part about this actor is his loyalty to his home country. He loves to be able to work in Canada as often as possible. He has been in many fantastic independent films such as _Fetching Cody (2005)_ (qv), _Just Buried (2007)_ (qv) and _Real Time (2008)_ (qv). All three of those films appeal to sides of a person that are never known to exist until it's too late.  He was also in many successful American comedy films. He was the lead in _She's Out of My League (2010)_ (qv) and played one of 'Seth Rogen' (qv)'s best friends (which he really is) in the movie _Knocked Up (2007)_ (qv). He's also made his mark in family-friendly films such as _How to Train Your Dragon (2010)_ (qv), playing the unlikely \"Viking Hiccup\" and also played the title role in _The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010)_ (qv) alongside his newly-found kindred spirit, actor 'Nicolas Cage' (qv).  It is no secret that while he enjoys acting, it truly is a means to an end. He is currently living his dream as he works on the hockey comedy _Goon (2011)_ (qv) and is working on many other films that are what he considers to be passion projects. Now he is making films that he has been preparing for all of his life and nothing can slow him down.",

While working as an assistant animator and layout artist for Hinton Animation Studios in Ottawa, Ontario, DeBlois simultaneously attended Sheridan College's three year Classical Animation program. Upon graduation in 1990, DeBlois was immediately hired by Don Bluth Studios in Dublin, Ireland. There, he cut his teeth as a layout artist, character designer, and storyboard assistant to Don Bluth on such films as \"Thumbelina\" and \"A Troll in Central Park.\" In 1994, DeBlois left Ireland to work for Walt Disney Feature Animation as a storyboard artist, where he soon replaced his frequent collaborator, Chris Sanders, as Head of Story on \"Mulan.\" Shortly thereafter, they re-re-teamed to create the lush and whimsical \"Lilo & Stitch,\" heralded by critics as Disney's last great hand-drawn film. Following its release in 2002, DeBlois sold several original live action feature projects to write, direct, and produce, including \"The Banshee and Finn Magee,\" \"The Lighthouse,\" and \"Sightings,\" set-up at Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Universal Studios respectively. At present, all three remain in development. 2007 unveiled DeBlois' first foray into documentary filmmaking, with the acclaimed feature length music film, \"Heima,\" chronicling the homecoming concert odyssey of Iceland's famed post-rock phenomenon, Sigur Rós. In October of 2008, DeBlois returned to feature animation to co-write and co-direct Dreamworks then-troubled \"How To Train Your Dragon,\" once again re-teaming with Sanders. The two re-envisioned the story from scratch, leading the production to its March, 2010 release, at break-neck speed. The resulting film earned Dreamworks Animation its highest critical acclaim to date and became the studio's top grossing film outside of the \"Shrek\" franchise. During this same time, DeBlois also directed another feature-length music film for Sigur Rós front-man Jónsi, entitled \"Go Quiet,\" as well as a feature length concert film entitled \"Jónsi: Live at The Wiltern.\" At present, DeBlois is writing, directing, and executive producing the highly anticipated sequel to \"How To Train Your Dragon,\" which he describes as \"the epic second act of a much larger story.\"",

Todd got his second big acting part as J.C. Croissant in the hilarious Kung Phooey!, which is obviously a Van Damme parody.  Todd is now gaining fame as being one of the better stunt men and also a great all-round athlete who enjoys football, baseball, basketball, tennis, bowling, golf, archery and his family.",

Denise grew up feeling equally comfortable both in European and North American cultures and considers both Spanish and English to be her \"first languages\".  While studying piano and ballet as a child, Denise discovered early on that she had a passion for acting and at age 12 began to attend acting classes.  At age 16, she was discovered by the top modeling agency in Spain, Traffic, and quickly signed by other international agencies including Ford in NYC. She became to appear in International fashion magazines, such as Vogue, Glamour, Marie Claire and Jalouse.  In 2005, during her first summer working in Paris, Dior representatives taken by the singular beauty of her face offered her a contract for the DIOR cosmetics campaign of Spring/Summer 2006. Denise continues to model under the name Denise Sommers.  Her first break came through a role in Manolete (2008) the film starring Oscar nominated Penelope Cruz and Oscar winner Adrien Brody. The intimate scene with the two awarding winning actors served as Denise's entry into the world of celluloid.  Denise studied Acting at ESAD,(Academy of Dramatic Arts) in Madrid, and Drama and Theatre Studies at Trinity College Dublin.  While still engaged in international film productions, Denise is currently based in London working in theatre and film.  In Spring 2012 she performed in \"The Oresteia\" by Aeschylus directed by Anastasia Revi (TheatreLab Company) at Riverside Studios, London, where she caught the attention of several theatre critics.",

                "info": "Marc began studying acting at age 6 appearing on Sigmund and the Sea Monsters. At the age of 10, Marc, joined the local Jewish Community Center workshops. His first scene was from Sweet Charity and he was hooked on musical theater. The following 8 years included continued Summer Stock musical performances, plays and founding his High Schools Drama Club. Upon acceptance into UC Irvine's Theater Department he came down with meningitis and had a brush with death. On the verge of losing his life and then beating the illness, it was goodbye college and off to the Hollywood grind. Studying with various singing, acting and dancing coaches he set out to be a triple threat. Pounding the pavements, audition after audition, bit parts, B-movies, cable movies, commercials, public service announcements, plays, musicals and tons of rejections. He began writing and decided that if anyone was going to turn him down for a part again, it would be, him. Driven by his thirst to create and produce, in 1992, he went back to school and earned his Juris Doctrate Degeree and became an Attorney so that he could earn enough money to produce the plays and films he was writing. In 1999, along with his life-long friend, Dave Cohen, they opened Res Ipsa Productions and produced the first play he wrote, Terminal. He then went on to re-write Terminal for the screen, and they produced the Award-Winning film Terminal. Marc has been nominated and won several awards for his work on Res Ipsa films, Commute, Grappling with your Demons and most recently was awarded the Golden Halo Award from the Southern California Motion Picture Council for his performance in Falling Down. Marc is in production on several projects with Ford Austin, including, Zebra Room and Guns, Hookers and a Pound of Coke",

                "info": "James Duval was born in the Midwest then, in 1970, moved with his family to Alaska by driving the Alcan Highway through Canada in a station wagon with fourteen people. He was raised in Fairbanks where he spent most of his younger years reading, writing and playing the violin. After graduating high school, he spent a year and half working with the Spanish speaking community of East Los Angeles, as a volunteer for the LDS Church.  James has been driven by the desire to create for as long as his parents can remember. From theater, road shows, writing and music he has spent most of his life being a creator and encouraging others to do the same.  In 1991 he moved to San Francisco to make movies. While at San Francisco State, he met Mark Lillig and the two of them decided to step away from a film education and into the actual practice of making movies. In 1996, they formed Independent Image Entertainment (IIE) with Tyler Ross and Richard Scott.  In 2004, after working on a project entitled Wrestling Days, two young filmmakers Danny Torres and Scott Hayman joined the IIE team. In late 2005 James Duval, Danny Torres, Scott Hayman, Mark R. Lillig, Tyler Ross and Richard Scott formed Continuum Pictures in Los Angeles.  Since the formation of Continuum Pictures, James Duval has produced many features, including Mano a Mano, Three Bad Men, Convict, The Absents, and others here in the US and internationally.  Through his experiences in life, James has been given the patience, time and opportunity to fall in love with movies and the people who make them while always giving credit to those films and people who inspired him.",

                "info": "Danny Torres  Though too young to be part of the \"Jaw's Baby\" generation of filmmakers, Danny Torres grew up still highly influenced by the films of Steven Spielberg, and considers himself part of the new generation of \"Jurassic Park Baby\" filmmakers. Born in Los Angeles, California to Salvadoran immigrants, Danny attended Loyola High School while still finding time to go to the movies every weekend with his father. Upon graduating, Danny moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to attend the University of California at Berkeley.  At the age of twenty, while still in college, Danny began working as a PA on a production with the indie film company Independent Image Entertainment (IIE). Approximately two weeks into production, based on the level of work and effort Danny was contributing to the production, the partners of IIE decided to make him a producer on the project and formally invited him to join the company. By the end of that year, Danny was voted in as the head of IIE by its nine partners, most of which were above the age of twenty-five. The following year, Danny supervised the release of all of IIE's productions and produced two more features by the time he graduated college.  At the beginning of 2006, Danny moved back to Los Angeles, along with six partners from IIE and formed a new company called Continuum Pictures, whose purpose was to produce studio-level projects. Since then, Danny has directly worked on numerous feature films, award-winning short films, and music videos. Danny's filmmaking experiences during that time have ranged from handling preproduction as a producer to being on set as a writer/director; he even became Continuum Pictures' most coveted cinematographer. Once the camera stops rolling, Danny often times finds himself in the editing room, either cutting a feature himself or assisting other editors in polishing their final edits.  As a writer, Danny has written three feature screenplays and worked as a script-doctor on numerous scripts, most of which have been green-lit based on his contributions.  Danny is now regularly consulted and has been instrumental in the formation of several smaller production companies, including Filmplane Entertainment. He strives to make every project begin with an \"A\" level script, no matter its genre or budget. A driven filmmaker, Danny's goal is to make the highest quality films for the widest audience possible.",

Since then, the ideas and stories have grown seeing the science fiction film 'Never Forget the Brave' (a cutaway from the Lost Transmission concept) filmed in 2011/12 with his largest cast and crew to date, 2 more short films linked to Lost Transmission are in development 'Vengeance of the Fallen' and the Earth based 'Terra Conflict'  In 2010, Rick's small production company went Limited in the UK, involving his wife, Ruth, who also happens to be the Catering Manager for the company.  Sometimes under scrutiny for his working ethics, Rick is adamant he will continue to treat all his cast and crew as an equal, no matter what experience level they might be at, to him everyone is valuable in making the film come to life",

                "info": "Highly inventive U.S. film director/producer/writer/actor Sam Raimi first came to the attention of film fans with the savage, yet darkly humorous, low-budget horror film, _The Evil Dead (1981)_ (qv). From his childhood, Raimi was a fan of the cinema and, before he was ten-years-old, he was out making movies with an 8mm camera. He was a devoted fan of 'The Three Stooges' (qv), so much of Raimi's film work in his teens, with good friends 'Bruce Campbell (I)' (qv) and 'Robert G. Tapert' (qv), was slapstick comedy based around what they had observed from \"Stooges\" movies.  Among the three of them, they wrote, directed, produced and edited a short horror movie titled _Within the Woods (1978)_ (qv), which was then shown to prospective investors to raise the money necessary to film _The Evil Dead (1981)_ (qv). It met with lukewarm interest in the U.S. with local distributors, so Raimi took the film to Europe, where it was much more warmly received. After it started gaining positive reviews and, more importantly, ticket sales upon its release in Europe, U.S. distributors showed renewed interest, and \"Evil Dead\" was eventually released stateside to strong box office returns. His next directorial effort was _Crimewave (1985)_ (qv), a quirky, cartoon-like effort that failed to catch fire with audiences. However, he bounced back with _Evil Dead II (1987)_ (qv), a racier and more humorous remake/sequel to the original \"Dead\" that did even better at the box office. Raimi was then given his biggest budget to date to shoot _Darkman (1990)_ (qv), a comic book-style fantasy about a scarred avenger. The film did moderate business, but Raimi's strong visual style was evident throughout the film via inventive and startling camera work that caught the attention of numerous critics.  The third chapter in the Evil Dead story beckoned, and Raimi once again directed buddy Campbell as the gritty hero \"Ash\", in the Gothic horror _Army of Darkness (1992)_ (qv). Raimi surprised fans when he took a turn away from the fantasy genre and directed 'Gene Hackman' (qv) and 'Sharon Stone (I)' (qv) in the sexy western, _The Quick and the Dead (1995)_ (qv); four years later, he took the directorial reins on _A Simple Plan (1998)_ (qv), a crime thriller about stolen money, starring 'Bill Paxton' (qv) and 'Bridget Fonda' (qv). In early 1999, he directed the baseball film, _For Love of the Game (1999)_ (qv), and, in 2000, returned to the fantasy genre with a top-flight cast in _The Gift (2000)_ (qv). In 2002, Raimi was given a real opportunity to demonstrate his dynamic visual style with the big-budget film adaptation of the 'Stan Lee (I)' (qv) comic book superhero, _Spider-Man (2002)_ (qv), and fans were not disappointed. The movie was strong in both script and effects, and was a runaway success at the box office. Of course, Raimi returned for the sequel, _Spider-Man 2 (2004)_ (qv), which surpassed the original in box-office takings.  Raimi remains one of Hollywood's most creative, exciting and intelligent filmmakers.",

                "info": "Daniel Craig, one of British theatre's most famous faces who was waiting tables as a struggling teenage actor with the NYT, went on to star as \"James Bond\" in _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv), _Quantum of Solace (2008)_ (qv) and _Skyfall (2012)_ (qv).  He was born Daniel Wroughton Craig on March 2, 1968, at 41 Liverpool Road, Chester, Cheshire, England. His father, Tim Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, then became landlord of \"Ring O' Bells\" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia Craig, was an art teacher. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel Craig was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of 6, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv)'s _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.  At the age of 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral, UK. He left Hilbre High at 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as \"Agamemnon\" in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director 'Edward Wilson (I)' (qv). He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside 'Ewan McGregor' (qv) and 'Alistair McGowan' (qv), then later 'Damian Lewis (I)' (qv) and 'Joseph Fiennes' (qv), among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of 'Colin McCormack (I)' (qv), the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named 'Ella Craig' (qv), was born in 1992. Daniel Craig made his film debut in _The Power of One (1992)_ (qv). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial _\"Our Friends in the North\" (1996)_ (qv). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in _Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)_ (qv) and _Road to Perdition (2002)_ (qv). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in _Layer Cake (2004)_ (qv), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray \"James Bond\", in October of 2005, weeks after he finished his work in _Munich (2005)_ (qv), where he co-starred with 'Eric Bana' (qv) under the directorship of 'Steven Spielberg' (qv).  Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool \"007\". He is the first blonde actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author 'Ian Fleming (I)' (qv) in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: 'Sean Connery' (qv), 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv), 'Timothy Dalton' (qv) and 'Pierce Brosnan' (qv) have indicated that Craig is a good choice as \"Bond\".",

He took to writing while schooling in Kitzbuhel, Austria, and upon failing the entrance requirements for Foreign Service joined the news agency Reuters as a journalist -- winning the respect of his peers for his coverage of a \"show trial\" in Russia of several Royal Engineers on espionage charges. Fleming briefly worked in the financial sector for the family bank, but just prior to the Second World War, was recruited into British Naval Intelligence where he excelled, shortly achieving the rank of Commander. When the war ended, Fleming retired to Jamaica where he built a house called \"Goldeneye,\" took up writing full-time and created the character that would make him famous -- British Secret Service agent James Bond, in a novel called \"Casino Royale.\" Fleming spent the rest of his life writing and traveling the world, but as his Bond character reached new heights of popularity on movie screens, Fleming was in ailing health. He died of a heart attack (his second) in England in August 1964 at the age of 56.",

Ben attended Samuel Whitbread Community College where his interest in theatre grew and he became a member of the Bancroft Players Youth Theatre at Hitchin's Queen Mother Theatre. During his time there he rose to prominence in many productions, most notably If This Is a Man, based on the book of the same name by 'Primo Levi' (qv), a survivor of Nazi World War II prisoner of war camp. The play was taken to the Edinburgh Festival in 1995 where it garnered five-star reviews and great critical acclaim with Ben Whishaw getting rave reviews for his portrayal of Levi. Ben then enrolled in, RADA from where he graduated in 2004 and soon landed the role of Hamlet in 'Trevor Nunn' (qv)'s 2004 production making him one of the youngest actors to portray Hamlet on-stage. Hamlet opened to rave reviews with many critics hailing Ben as the next 'Laurence Olivier' (qv) and applauding his portrayal of Hamlet with leading critics haling the birth of a star. Whishaw's film and TV credits include _Layer Cake (2004)_ (qv) and 'Christopher Morris (I)' (qv)' 2005 sitcom _\"Nathan Barley\" (2005)_ (qv), in which he played a character called Pingu. He was named \"Most Promising Newcomer\" at the 2001 British Independent Film Awards (for _My Brother Tom (2001)_ (qv)) and, in 2005, nominated as best actor in four award ceremonies for his Hamlet. He also played 'Keith Richards (II)' (qv) in the 'Stephen Woolley' (qv) biopic _Stoned (2005)_ (qv). Whishaw played in _Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (2006)_ (qv) as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, a perfume maker whose craft turns deadly getting raves once again for his stunning portrayal. Whishaw appeared in 2007's _I'm Not There (9999)_ as one of the 'Bob Dylan' (qv) reincarnations and in 2008 in _\"Criminal Justice\" (2008)_ (qv) a TV series.

                "info": "She is one of the entertainment industry's most successful female producers. Barbara Broccoli was born to legendary filmmaker 'Albert R. Broccoli' (qv), affectionately known as Cubby, and 'Dana Broccoli' (qv) on June 18, 1960. Not long after, Cubby Broccoli and his new partner, 'Harry Saltzman' (qv), secured studio backing for an ambitious series of films inspired by the popular James Bond novels written by 'Ian Fleming (I)' (qv).  Ms. Broccoli grew up in the behind-the-scenes world of James Bond, traveling with her family around the world to various exotic locations. As a child, she liked to play with the photocopy machines in the offices of Eon Productions, Ltd., her father's company responsible for the Bond films. During location shooting in Japan for _You Only Live Twice (1967)_ (qv), young Barbara caught a fever from the Japanese custom of sleeping on the floor. 'Sean Connery' (qv), whose star status provided him with a comfortable bed, generously relinquished it so Barbara could properly fight her illness.  She graduated from Loyola University in Los Angeles, California with a degree in motion picture and television communications. Her first official credited job on the Bond films was for 1983's _Octopussy (1983)_ (qv) in which she served as an executive assistant. But, as with any family business, one helps out where one can. For instance, in her father's autobiography \"When The Snow Melts\", she recalls a nightmarish situation involving _A View to a Kill (1985)_ (qv) star 'Grace Jones (I)' (qv). Later, for the two 'Timothy Dalton' (qv) Bond films, she was promoted to associate producer, a post she shared with veteran Bond associate producer 'Tom Pevsner' (qv).  The August 8, 1990 issue of Variety (weekly) reported that aging Cubby Broccoli had turned control of Eon Productions Ltd. over to Barbara and her half-brother, 'Michael G. Wilson (I)' (qv) (Dana's son, who had been an invaluable help to Cubby and the Bond franchise in various capacities since the mid-1970s). Due to some unfortunate business dealings with then-MGM ownership (the studio that bankrolled Bond and held significant interest in the series), production of the Bond films was put on what would become a six year hiatus.  When the litigation was settled, \"Bond 17\" (eventually named _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv)) was on track and Barbara Broccoli, now a full producer alongside 'Michael G. Wilson (I)' (qv), was faced with the challenge of bringing Bond back to the big screen. She has earned a reputation as being tough when she has to be and for volunteering for the toughest jobs, such as overseeing the Russian location unit. _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) was a world-wide smash, and each of the succeeding Bond films were also enormously popular. This is a testament to the talent of Cubby Broccoli, who passed his knowledge of high-stakes film production on to Michael and later Barbara. The benefit of Cubby's experience is obvious when viewing the newest Bond films starring 'Pierce Brosnan' (qv).  Her non-Bond producing credits include _Crime of the Century (1996) (TV)_ (qv), which deals with the murder trial from the famous Lindberg kidnapping, and the popular London Stage production of \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\", which was co-produced by her mother 'Dana Broccoli' (qv) and half-brother 'Michael G. Wilson.' Both productions carried a personal interest for Ms. Broccoli. Charles Lindberg was her father's favorite hero, and \"Chitty\" was adapted from the film produced by her father, which was based upon the children's novel by 'Ian Fleming (I)' (qv).",

From here, Harris won roles in various projects, such as _\"Simon and the Witch\" (1987)_ (qv) and _\"The Tomorrow People\" (1992)_ (qv). She went on to study social and political sciences at Pembroke College, Cambridge University, an experience Harris did not enjoy.  After graduating from University, Harris trained at Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. Acting success soon followed and her breakthrough film role came in 'Danny Boyle' (qv)'s _28 Days Later... (2002)_ (qv). Other notable projects include _Miami Vice (2006)_ (qv) and _Small Island (2009) (TV)_ (qv) (for which she was named best female actor by the Royal Television Society). Harris also won fans for her role as Tia Dalma in the blockbusting \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" films and further international attention came her way when she was cast as Field Agent Eve in the twenty third James Bond film, _Skyfall (2012)_ (qv).",

                "info": "Jon Lee Brody was born and raised in the Northwest Suburbs of Chicago. His father of German and Jewish decent and his mother of Korean decent, worked as a civil engineer and business consultant, respectively. Jon attended William Fremd High School where he excelled as a three sport athlete and also excelled academically. His aspirations were to be a professional athlete and like many kids in Chicago he wanted to 'be like Mike'. During high school, Jon was also a Golden Gloves boxer, an avid Martial Artist (he is a second degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do) and also was in the schools' symphony orchestra where he played the violin.  Jon went on to play football at the University of Illinois. However in his sophomore season, Jon suffered an injury that ultimately ended his playing career. He stayed in school and graduated in May of 2007 with a dual degree in Accounting and Finance. Jon was accepted for admissions to prestigious law schools like Harvard and Northwestern, but he instead chose to go against the grain and pursue his other childhood dream: acting. He didn't wait long to buy a one way ticket to Los Angeles, and since then he hasn't looked back.",

Most people don't know, but when I'm not shooting Big Time Rush, I am producing movies. In the past few years I have produced a pilot called \"Small Business\" for Comedy Central Digital, I was a producer on the Twilight spoof movie \"Breaking Wind\" for Lionsgate, and most recently I produced \"30 Nights of Paranormal Activity with the Devil Inside the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" which got distribution by 20th Century Fox. While making these films I have always run into the same problem when it comes to hiring animals. It's incredibly costly on a small budget to afford to have a dog on set, let alone a zebra. That is why I started Independent Film Animals. This company will help directors and producers get the vision that have worked so hard to achieve without going bankrupt. Our company will provide a wide range of animals for new projects. Whether you need Camels to ride in the desert, Otters to swim in your pool, Pigs to ride in your car or a Kangaroo to sit at your desk, I.F.A. will make your dreams a reality.",

                "info": "Justin Murphy is a graduate of Jacksonville University and the founder of the production company Omega Theatre Productions. He began his producing and directing career on the stage with a highly successful production of Jesus Christ Superstar at the Florida Theatre in 1999, where he starred in the title role opposite Delisco, winner of E! Network's reality show The Entertainer.  His first passion has always been art and when he was only 17 he wrote, illustrated and published his first comic book series titled Southern Blood. The book received national distribution with Diamond Comics and continued to be published until Justin graduated from college in 1998.  His writing partnership with composer Roger Butterley began in 1994 when the two collaborated on concept music for the musical Eagle Song. Six years later they would complete the show and record a full symphonic recording that starred Delisco and Jamie Lynn Sigler. In 2002 Justin wrote a rock opera with Butterley called Fallen Angel and produced and directed the theatrical DVD version two years later. In 2006, Fallen Angel was accepted into the New York International Fringe Festival where it won the award for Most Outstanding Musical.  Returning to comics, Murphy wrote and illustrated \"Cleburne: A Graphic Novel\". After its publication from Rampart Press in December 2008, \"Cleburne\" went on to win the Book of the Year Award by ForeWord Magazine. The property is now in development for a film adaptation.",

Noah started his way to stardom in commercials (in which he began to appear at age three). In 1978, he landed the role of Boxey on the cult Sci-Fi show, _\"Battlestar Galactica\" (1978)_ (qv). Later that year, he played the role of Atreyu in _Die unendliche Geschichte (1984)_ (qv) and the lead as Harry Potter Jr. in _Troll (1986)_ (qv). He taught advanced jazz and street dance in his late teens until an injury forced him to quit at 18. Afterwards, he studied Muay Thai boxing and then fought as an amateur. Noah then stayed out of the limelight until 1992 for the drama _To Die, to Sleep (1994)_ (qv).  Prior to moving back to LA in 1998, he lived in New York for two and a half years. In his spare time, he tries to get out to the track at Willow Springs, California, to race in Super Sport motorcycle racing. He has tended bar at several LA clubs and has several tattoos. He holds black belts in Tang Soo Do and Shotokan, and is currently learning American Kenpo from Dr Jerry Erickson, and he also helps him teach \"a close-quarter combat-training course for flight attendants and pilots for the airlines.\"",

When Dante's prophecized kingship turns out to be part of a much larger and more sinister scheme, the young elf's future as king goes from being the stuff of dreams to that of an unavoidable nightmare. As events unfold, Dante begins to change into something scheming and wicked, and the hero who once swore to love and protect him now finds himself vowing to stop him at all costs. Monsters from the fantasy genre abound in the form of goblins, trolls, dwarves, elves, and more in this dark re-imagining of the age-old \"boy who would be king\" tale. While the tone is at times dark and grim, there are still precious moments of humor, humanity, and a sense of wonder at a world far more fantastic than our own.",

                "info": "'Guillermo del Toro' (qv) was born October 9, 1964 in Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico. Raised by his Catholic grandmother, del Toro developed an interest in filmmaking in his early teens. Later, he learned about makeup and effects from the legendary 'Dick Smith (II)' (qv) (_The Exorcist (1973)_ (qv)) and worked on making his own short films. At the age of 21, del Toro executive produced his first feature, Dona Herlinda and Her Son (1986). Del Toro spent almost 10 years as a makeup supervisor, and formed his own company, Necropia in the early 1980s. He also produced and directed Mexican television programs at this time, and taught film.  del Toro got his first big break when _Cronos (1993)_ (qv) won nine academy awards in Mexico, then went on to win the International Critics Week prize at Cannes. Following this success, del Toro made his first Hollywood film, _Mimic (1997)_ (qv), starring 'Mira Sorvino' (qv).  del Toro had some unfortunate experiences working with a demanding Hollywood studio on _Mimic (1997)_ (qv), and returned to Mexico to form his own production company, The Tequila Gang.  Next for del Toro, was _El espinazo del diablo (2001)_ (qv), a Spanish Civil War ghost story. The film was hailed by critics and audiences alike, and del Toro decided to give Hollywood another try. In 2002, he directed the 'Wesley Snipes' (qv) vampire sequel, _Blade II (2002)_ (qv).  On a roll, Del Toro followed up _Blade II (2002)_ (qv) with another successful comic-book inspired film, _Hellboy (2004)_ (qv), starring one of Del Toro's favorite actors, 'Ron Perlman' (qv).  Married with children, del Toro lives in Los Angeles.",

It looked at rigidity and brutality with an almost clinical eye. It is, for me, a singular film about the military, about war and its consequences. The famous scenes, like the induction with R Lee Ermey where he renames the soldiers and reshapes them into sub-human maggots, had a particular impact on me. Also the suicide scene with Vincent D'Onofrio in the bathroom. And the sniper set-piece at the end. Those are absolutely virtuoso pieces of filmmaking.",

Both his mother and father worked in the same factory; his father as a factory worker and his mother as a secretary. His parents divorced when he was 23, soon after he moved to England. His father passed away aged 60 due to heart attack. Alessandro was in his late 20s, and he was on vacation in Los Angeles when he received the call. His career began in Milan at the age of 19, where he appeared in photo shoots for some local magazines. Not happy with the results, he soon took the decision to move to England. Not knowing the language, he started his first job as a glass collector in a local night club in Loughborough, Leicestershire. Soon after, he managed to find a job in a factory, where he spent the next year. During this period, his english improved to such a level that allowed him to start attending acting classes. At the age of 26 he moved to London, and he found himself a job as computer programmer, using this money to support his acting career. He attends many evening classes, from acting and pronunciation courses, to drama workshops, where he has met and learnt from many accomplished actors. This includes a one-to-one breakfast meeting with 'Bill Nighy' (qv), from which he gathered some very useful information, accelerating the progression of his acting career. His latest role sees him work closely with 'Martha Fiennes' (qv) (sister of 'Ralph Fiennes' (qv)) in the Nativity project, where he was selected to play the role of Angel Gabriel. The project was shown in Covent Garden piazza (London) for 2 months (2 November 2011 - 2January 2012).",

Already after a few shows he was given his own DJ program each week. At a few occasions Kim also went on-air on the National Danish Radio. During this time, he also starred in several commercials on both radio and television. As the local radio station had to close, he went on to writing for a couple of magazines, both paper and Internet based, in most cases film-related. Since then starring in quite a few underground short films before finally being accepted to theatreschool in 1998, where, during his stay, he and a fellow student wrote manuscripts for no less than three feature films.  After graduation in 2001 he moved to Copenhagen, where he was soon offered a minor role in the blockbuster, _Klatretøsen (2002)_ (qv) (\"Catch That Girl\"), and since then things have quickly taken off.  In 2004 he produced and starred in the feature film _Brutal Incasso (2005)_ (qv) that we wrote back in theatreschool. The film has later won the Audience Award for Best Film at The Weekend Of Fear Film Festival in 2006 and nominated for Best Foreign Film at a couple of other film festivals.  In 2006 he directed his first short film _Mental Distortion (2007)_ (qv) (which was released as part of _The Horror Vault (2008)_ (qv)) alongside doing his first feature film as a director _Craig (2008)_ (qv). Besides directing both films, he also played the lead character and both films were finished in late 2007.",

Her father Chris Calvey is Scottish and works as a Photographer, the couple divorced when Mhairi was just age 2. Dominique then moved with her daughter to the Isle Of Arran on the West Coast of Scotland where she spent the rest of her childhood. Related to actor Wolf Kahler acting is in the blood which meant Mhairi was a film buff from an early age. Suddenly at the age of 5, Mhairi was to make her first debut on the Silver Screen when she played the 'Young Murron' in Mel Gibson's film \"Braveheart\". After the film Dominique got advice from a movie casting director, it was decided, it was not a good idea for Mhairi to enter the world of becoming a child star; Mhairi returned to school and started in the Theatre. Dominique struggled to support her daughter being a single parent. When Mhairi was age 11 they moved to North Yorkshire, England where Dominique met Mhairi's step father Tim Bielby a joiner. Mhairi suffered from bullying a lot at high school so she seeked refuge in acting roles. When Mhairi went to college she was spotted by a Theatre Director Sam Beswick who saw Miss Calvey's talent in a one women show she performed at York college. During her college years Mhairi made contact with the actors James Robinson 'Young William Wallace' and Andrew Weir 'Young Hamish Campbell' (Braveheart), and 2006 Mhairi flew to New York to take part in Dressed to Kilt along with her co - actors, James and Andrew. It was the first time they were all seen together since they were kids. In New York Miss Calvey took part in the event with fellow Scots Sir Sean Connery and Brian Cox amongst many others. Then later on that year Miss Calvey was invited back to Dressed to kilt this time to go to L.A where she met Linda Hamilton, Ashley Jensen and again many more. At age 18, Mhairi was accepted with Scholarship into the Guildford School of Acting and graduated in 2010. After only four months after graduation Mhairi got her first lead role in the feature film Any Minute Now and is now shooting movies in the UK and abroad.",

Denise grew up feeling equally comfortable both in European and North American cultures and considers both Spanish and English to be her \"first languages\".  While studying piano and ballet as a child, Denise discovered early on that she had a passion for acting and at age 12 began to attend acting classes.  At age 16, she was discovered by the top modeling agency in Spain, Traffic, and quickly signed by other international agencies including Ford in NYC. She became to appear in International fashion magazines, such as Vogue, Glamour, Marie Claire and Jalouse.  In 2005, during her first summer working in Paris, Dior representatives taken by the singular beauty of her face offered her a contract for the DIOR cosmetics campaign of Spring/Summer 2006. Denise continues to model under the name Denise Sommers.  Her first break came through a role in Manolete (2008) the film starring Oscar nominated Penelope Cruz and Oscar winner Adrien Brody. The intimate scene with the two awarding winning actors served as Denise's entry into the world of celluloid.  Denise studied Acting at ESAD,(Academy of Dramatic Arts) in Madrid, and Drama and Theatre Studies at Trinity College Dublin.  While still engaged in international film productions, Denise is currently based in London working in theatre and film.

                "info": "A talented actor, comedian and writer, Seth Rogen has come a long way from doing stand-up comedy as a teen. Rogen was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, to Mark and Sandy Rogen. He attended Vancouver Talmud Torah Elementary School and Point Grey Secondary School (although he dropped out of high school to move to Los Angeles) and was known for the stand-up comedy he performed at Camp Miriam, a Habonim Dror camp. At 16, Rogan came in second place in the 1998 Vancouver Amateur Comedy Contest.  Soon after that win he landed his first role in 'Judd Apatow' (qv)'s short-lived but well regarded TV series _\"Freaks and Geeks\" (1999)_ (qv), taking on the role of Ken Miller. Though the show only lasted one season, it was the launching pad for many careers, including Rogen, Apatow, 'James Franco' (qv), and 'Jason Segel' (qv). This early work sharpened Rogen's keen improvisational skills, which he's used on many projects since.  Following _\"Freaks and Geeks\" (1999)_ (qv), he participated in a few unsuccessful television projects, and then joined the American television version of _\"Da Ali G Show\" (2003)_ (qv) as a writer during its second and last season, along with his childhood friend and writing partner 'Evan Goldberg (I)' (qv). The writing team received an Emmy nomination. As a huge fan of the first season, Rogen was thrilled to get the chance to work with 'Sacha Baron Cohen' (qv).  Continuing his work with Apatow, he joined the cast of Apatow's debut film _The 40 Year Old Virgin (2005)_ (qv) and is credited as co-producer. After that he took the lead in _Knocked Up (2007)_ (qv), Apatow's second movie and a huge success. He's since been a frequent collaborator with Apatow, in projects such as _Superbad (2007)_ (qv), _Pineapple Express (2008)_ (qv) and _Funny People (2009)_ (qv). He co-wrote _Superbad (2007)_ (qv), with Goldberg; the pair started the project when they were teens. They won the Canadian Comedy Award for Best Writing in a Film in 2008. They later wrote _Pineapple Express (2008)_ (qv) and _The Green Hornet (2011)_ (qv), also starring Rogen.  A talented voice artist, Rogen is in the animated films _Horton Hears a Who! (2008)_ (qv), _Kung Fu Panda (2008)_ (qv), and _Monsters vs Aliens (2009)_ (qv), and has voiced characters for _\"The Simpsons\" (1989)_ (qv) and _\"American Dad!\" (2005)_ (qv).  Rogen was named the Canadian Comedy Person of the Year by the Canadian Comedy Awards in both 2008 and 2009.  Rogen lives in Los Angeles with 'Lauren Miller (I)' (qv), whom he met in 2004. They became engaged in September 2010 and married in October 2011.",

                "info": "Leonardo DiCaprio is an American-born actor whose portrayal of doomed suitor Jack Dawson in _Titanic (1997)_ (qv) made him a generation's definition of a heartthrob. Throughout his career, DiCaprio has demonstrated a high level of dramatic versatility, from his breakout film role as a mentally-challenged teenager in _What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)_ (qv), through his work with 'Martin Scorsese' (qv) in _Gangs of New York (2002)_ (qv) and _The Departed (2006)_ (qv). More recently, DiCaprio earned critical notice for his starring roles in 'Christopher Nolan (I)' (qv)'s _Inception (2010)_ (qv) and _J. Edgar (2011)_ (qv), for which he received a Golden Globe nomination.  Born in 11 November, 1974 in Los Angeles, California, DiCaprio is the only child of former comic book artist George DiCaprio and Irmelin DiCaprio. His parents signed him with a talent agent when he was a child, and DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational shows. Although the budding actor had small roles in such TV series as _\"Roseanne\" (1988)_ (qv) and _\"The New Lassie\" (1989)_ (qv), DiCaprio's made his film debut in _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv), a low-budget horror movie.  In 1992, DiCaprio joined what became the final season of _\"Growing Pains\" (1985)_ (qv), playing a homeless boy who was invited to move in with the Seavers. The sitcom's cancelation coincided with an upswing in his career, including the starring role in the film adaptation of 'Jim Carroll (I)' (qv)'s _The Basketball Diaries (1995)_ (qv) and his heightened portrayal of Romeo in 'Baz Luhrmann' (qv)'s _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv). Although DiCaprio's Romeo raised his profile with audiences, his turn in the box office record-breaking _Titanic (1997)_ (qv) graduated the actor to A-list status.  The majority of DiCaprio's post-Titanic career demonstrates a high level of selectivity in his choices. In addition to numerous collaborations with Scorsese, DiCaprio has also starred in films directed by 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) (_Catch Me If You Can (2002)_ (qv)), 'Ridley Scott' (qv) (_Body of Lies (2008)_ (qv)), and 'Sam Mendes (I)' (qv) (_Revolutionary Road (2008)_ (qv)), in roles that encompass a wide emotional and dramatic range. This continues to be the case, evident in his upcoming film appearances as a mustache-twirling villain in _Django Unchained (2012)_ (qv), soon to be followed by his performance as tragic literary character Jay Gatsby in _The Great Gatsby (2013)_ (qv).  DiCaprio is passionate about environmental and humanitarian causes, having donated $1,000,000 to earthquake relief efforts in 2010, the same year he contributed $1,000,000 to the Wildlife Conservation Society.",

                "info": "Few actors in the world have had a career quite as diverse as Leonardo DiCaprio's. DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom _\"Growing Pains\" (1985)_ (qv) and low budget horror movies, such as _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) and _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as 'Martin Scorsese' (qv) and 'Christopher Nolan (I)' (qv). But such a rich, varied career is what you would expect from someone who has had such an unusual upbring as DiCaprio.  Leonardo DiCaprio is the only child of former comic book artist 'George DiCaprio (I)' (qv) and 'Irmelin DiCaprio' (qv) (both born 1943). Leonardo's father, George, had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late 'Harvey Pekar', a friend of George's. However, Leonardo's performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name \"Lenny Williams\", DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs. DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in bit part roles in a number of television series, such as _\"Roseanne\" (1988)_ (qv) and _\"The New Lassie\" (1989)_ (qv), but it wasn't until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv), a low-budget horror movie.  While _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv) did little to help showcase DiCaprio's acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom _\"Growing Pains\" (1985)_ (qv), in which Leonardo was cast in the \"Cousin Oliver\" role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio's stint on _\"Growing Pains\" (1985)_ (qv) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public's attention and, after the show ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops. Leonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in _What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)_ (qv), a young gunslinger in _The Quick and the Dead (1995)_ (qv) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, \"Jim Carroll\", in _The Basketball Diaries (1995)_ (qv), a role which the late 'River Phoenix' (qv) originally expressed interest in.  While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo's reputation as an actor, it wasn't until his role as \"Romeo\" in 'Baz Luhrmann' (qv)'s _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time, _Titanic (1997)_ (qv) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio's reputation as a teen heartthrob.  Following his work on _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in _The Man in the Iron Mask (1998/I)_ (qv) and the low-budget _The Beach (2000/I)_ (qv) being some of his few notable roles during this period. However, in 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_ (qv) and _Gangs of New York (2002)_ (qv), his first of many collaborations with director 'Martin Scorsese' (qv).  With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment.  As someone who has gone from bit parts in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continues to defy conventions about the types of roles he will accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all star casts in action thrillers such as _The Departed (2006)_ (qv), _Shutter Island (2010)_ (qv) and 'Christopher Nolan (I)' (qv)'s _Inception (2010)_ (qv), DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any cliché about actors. DiCaprio is not merely a former teen heartthrob turned leading man, he is one of the most respected, daring and challenging actors working today.",

De Niro was going up to the kids with this almost empty mustard jar and cramming it into their faces, really pushing the kids' buttons. The scene was being used to see if the kid could stand up to De Niro, and it was hard not to be overwhelmed. When he started bludgeoning me, I completely overcompensated. He said, \"Is this empty? Is this empty?\" I slapped the jar out of his hand, got right up in his face, and screamed at the top of my lungs, \"Noooooooo!\" It was the most god-awful way to do the scene. I was supposed to be the victim, not the antagonizer, and there was complete silence. De Niro looks at me and goes, \"Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh\", in that way only De Niro can laugh. \"That was good. That was goooood. I like that. A little over-the-top but good\". My audition was supposed to go on, but they just stopped it. Even though De Niro said he liked it, I left the room thinking, Oh, shit, I'm a laughingstock. I'm buried. I'm done. Getting that part felt like winning the lottery.

The Comics Code Authority declared that they would not give their seal of approval to the three-issue arc on the grounds that the code, which was notorious for being draconian, would not allow the depiction of drug use even when it is portrayed negatively. Confident that the original government request would give him credibility and with the support of his publisher, Martin Goodman, Lee decided to defy the CCA and published the story as is without the seal and received healthy sales and a positive public reaction for his efforts in portraying the social problem.

He is also the writer of the US industry's biggest-selling comic book of the past decade, Marvel's Civil War, published in 2007. His Wanted comic series was the industry's biggest-selling creator-owned book of the last ten years until he smashed his own record with Kick-Ass, each issue selling more than Spider-Man and X-Men from issue one with an unprecedented five printings every issue. Both properties were sold as movies before the first issue hit the stands and everything Millar has ever created is in various stages of theatrical development. Wanted starred Angelina Jolie and James McAvoy. Kick-Ass stars actor Nicolas Cage.  Outside comics, Millar has been praised by Marvel Studios and screenwriter Zak Penn for creating the template for their 2008-2012 line-up of movies, their 2011 and 2012 Captain America and The Avengers movies based on Millar's Ultimates monthly series. He cast Samuel L Jackson as the leader of this super-team and his influence extends into every Marvel movie on their upcoming slate. Although busy creating his own movies and comic-books now at Millarworld, Millar remains under contract at Marvel to write their most high-profile projects.",

                "info": "Matthew Vaughn is an English film producer and director. He is known for producing such films as _Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)_ (qv) and _Snatch. (2000)_ (qv) and for directing the crime thriller, _Layer Cake (2004)_ (qv), the fantasy epic, _Stardust (2007)_ (qv), the superhero comedy, _Kick-Ass (2010)_ (qv), and the superhero film, _X-Men: First Class (2011)_ (qv). Vaughn was educated at Stowe School in Buckingham, England. Taking a gap year between Stowe and university, he traveled the world on a Hard Rock Cafe tour and landed in Los Angeles, U.S. Here, he began working as an assistant to a director. He returned to London, attending University College London where he studied anthropology and ancient history. But the film bug had taken hold. He dropped out of university after a few weeks and returned to Los Angeles to start his career. He quickly realized, however, that everyone in town was trying to do the same thing, so he crossed back over the Atlantic to make a name for himself in England. At 25, he produced a little-seen thriller, _The Innocent Sleep (1996)_ (qv), starring 'Annabella Sciorra' (qv) and 'Michael Gambon' (qv). Vaughn continued as a producer on close friend 'Guy Ritchie' (qv)'s film, _Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)_ (qv). The film was a success in all aspects; earning Vaughn and Ritchie £9 million each. Vaughn would go on to produce Ritchie's equally acclaimed _Snatch. (2000)_ (qv) and the critically-mauled, _Swept Away (2002)_ (qv). Vaughn made his directorial debut in 2004 with _Layer Cake (2004)_ (qv). The film was well-received and its success led to Vaughn being tapped to direct _X-Men: The Last Stand (2006)_ (qv) but he later dropped out only two weeks before filming began. Vaughn was, subsequently, very critical of 'Brett Ratner' (qv)'s direction of _X-Men: The Last Stand (2006)_ (qv) (aka X-Men 3). Vaughn next directed _Stardust (2007)_ (qv) and a movie adaption of 'Mark Millar (I)' (qv)'s Kick-Ass. He was also in talks to direct an adaptation of \"Thor\", but left that project. In May 2010, 20th Century Fox confirmed that Vaughn will direct _X-Men: First Class (2011)_ (qv) and announced the film will be released on June 3, 2011. Vaughn is best known for starting his career working as a producer for the 'Guy Ritchie' (qv) films, _Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)_ (qv), _Snatch. (2000)_ (qv) and _Swept Away (2002)_ (qv). 'Jane Goldman (I)' (qv) is one the screenwriters who Vaughn collaborated with for the films, _Stardust (2007)_ (qv), _Kick-Ass (2010)_ (qv) and the upcoming _X-Men: First Class (2011)_ (qv). The actors that Vaughn usually works with in his films are 'Jason Statham' (qv), 'Vinnie Jones' (qv), 'Jason Flemyng' (qv), 'Adam Fogerty' (qv), 'Sienna Miller' (qv), 'Brad Pitt' (qv) (as a producer on _Kick-Ass (2010)_ (qv)), 'Mark Strong (II)' (qv), 'Robbie Gee' (qv), 'Alan Ford (I)' (qv), 'Tamer Hassan' (qv) and 'Dexter Fletcher (I)' (qv). Vaughn's wife is German supermodel 'Claudia Schiffer' (qv), whom he married in Shimpling, Suffolk, in 2002. The couple have three children: son Caspar Matthew (born 30 January 2003), daughter Clementine de Vere Drummond (born 11 November 2004) and a second daughter, Cosima Violet (born 14 May 2010). They have homes in Suffolk and Notting Hill. He has hired ex-Gurkha soldiers for security for him and his wife following reports of stalkers apparently intruding their house.",

                "info": "James Duval was born in the Midwest then, in 1970, moved with his family to Alaska by driving the Alcan Highway through Canada in a station wagon with fourteen people. He was raised in Fairbanks where he spent most of his younger years reading, writing and playing the violin. After graduating high school, he spent a year and half working with the Spanish speaking community of East Los Angeles, as a volunteer for the LDS Church.  James has been driven by the desire to create for as long as his parents can remember. From theater, road shows, writing and music he has spent most of his life being a creator and encouraging others to do the same.  In 1991 he moved to San Francisco to make movies. While at San Francisco State, he met Mark Lillig and the two of them decided to step away from a film education and into the actual practice of making movies. In 1996, they formed Independent Image Entertainment (IIE) with Tyler Ross and Richard Scott.  In 2004, after working on a project entitled Wrestling Days, two young filmmakers Danny Torres and Scott Hayman joined the IIE team. In late 2005 James Duval, Danny Torres, Scott Hayman, Mark R. Lillig, Tyler Ross and Richard Scott formed Continuum Pictures in Los Angeles.  Since the formation of Continuum Pictures, James Duval has produced many features, including Mano a Mano, Three Bad Men, Convict, The Absents, and others here in the US and internationally.  Through his experiences in life, James has been given the patience, time and opportunity to fall in love with movies and the people who make them while always giving credit to those films and people who inspired him.",

                "info": "Danny Torres  Though too young to be part of the \"Jaw's Baby\" generation of filmmakers, Danny Torres grew up still highly influenced by the films of Steven Spielberg, and considers himself part of the new generation of \"Jurassic Park Baby\" filmmakers. Born in Los Angeles, California to Salvadoran immigrants, Danny attended Loyola High School while still finding time to go to the movies every weekend with his father. Upon graduating, Danny moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to attend the University of California at Berkeley.  At the age of twenty, while still in college, Danny began working as a PA on a production with the indie film company Independent Image Entertainment (IIE). Approximately two weeks into production, based on the level of work and effort Danny was contributing to the production, the partners of IIE decided to make him a producer on the project and formally invited him to join the company. By the end of that year, Danny was voted in as the head of IIE by its nine partners, most of which were above the age of twenty-five. The following year, Danny supervised the release of all of IIE's productions and produced two more features by the time he graduated college.  At the beginning of 2006, Danny moved back to Los Angeles, along with six partners from IIE and formed a new company called Continuum Pictures, whose purpose was to produce studio-level projects. Since then, Danny has directly worked on numerous feature films, award-winning short films, and music videos. Danny's filmmaking experiences during that time have ranged from handling preproduction as a producer to being on set as a writer/director; he even became Continuum Pictures' most coveted cinematographer. Once the camera stops rolling, Danny often times finds himself in the editing room, either cutting a feature himself or assisting other editors in polishing their final edits.  As a writer, Danny has written three feature screenplays and worked as a script-doctor on numerous scripts, most of which have been green-lit based on his contributions.  Danny is now regularly consulted and has been instrumental in the formation of several smaller production companies, including Filmplane Entertainment. He strives to make every project begin with an \"A\" level script, no matter its genre or budget. A driven filmmaker, Danny's goal is to make the highest quality films for the widest audience possible.",

His father of German and Jewish decent and his mother of Korean decent, worked as a civil engineer and business consultant, respectively. Jon attended William Fremd High School where he excelled as a three sport athlete and also excelled academically. His aspirations were to be a professional athlete and like many kids in Chicago he wanted to 'be like Mike'. During high school, Jon was also a Golden Gloves boxer, an avid Martial Artist (he is a second degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do) and also was in the schools' symphony orchestra where he played the violin.  Jon went on to play football at the University of Illinois. However in his sophomore season, Jon suffered an injury that ultimately ended his playing career. He stayed in school and graduated in May of 2007 with a dual degree in Accounting and Finance. Jon was accepted for admissions to prestigious law schools like Harvard and Northwestern, but he instead chose to go against the grain and pursue his other childhood dream: acting. He didn't wait long to buy a one way ticket to Los Angeles, and since then he hasn't looked back.",

                "info": "Lester Speight is a film and television actor best known for his portrayal of Terry Tate: Office Linebacker in a series of Reebok commercials that first aired during Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003. The spots feature Speight, a former All-American Football player himself, as a linebacker charged with the no-holds barred enforcement of office policies. The commercials achieved much critical acclaim and were ranked the most watched of the Super Bowl by The Hollywood Reporter. The popular character recently made a return appearance in a series of ads campaign in support of voting. Amongst the Office Linebacker's new tackles included former Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin.  As determined and hardworking on screen as a linebacker is on the field, Speight has appeared with such stars as Eddie Murphy, Damon Wayans, Anthony Anderson, and even Optimus Prime. His television work includes a recurring role on the ABC series \"My Wife and Kids,\" as well as guest starring appearance on \"Prison Break,\" \"Bones,\" and \"Cold Case.\" On the silver screen he has appeared in hit films such as \"Transformers: Dark of the Moon,\" \"Norbit,\" and \"Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay.\"  Aside from Terry Tate however, Speight is probably most recognized by fans of the Gears of War video game series for the XBOX 360. Speight won the G-Phoria award for Best Voiceover in 2007 by the G4 Network for his performance as Augustus Cole (AKA Cole Train), a character that was modeled after Speight and includes subtle allusions to the Office Linebacker.",

                "info": "Bruce Dern had established himself as the movies' premier heavy, playing sociopaths, psychotics and just plain criminals by the time he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for _Coming Home (1978)_ (qv). Some perceptive critics had noted that Dern was a finer actor than his roles generally allowed one to believe, repelled as one was by the neurotic persona that Dern was able to project and that casting directors capitalized on.  'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), a close friend, claimed that Dern was the best of the new breed of actors who had been born just before World War II and were coming into their own in the 1970s. Unlike his screen image, Dern had come from a patrician background: his grandfather had been governor of Utah and a secretary of war under 'Franklin D. Roosevelt' (qv). When allowed to step out of his on-screen persona to assay the millionaire Tom Buchanan in the 1974 remake of _The Great Gatsby (1974)_ (qv), he acquitted himself quite well.  Some critics said that \"Gatsby\" would have been better if Dern rather than 'Robert Redford (I)' (qv) had played the title role. Others pointed to his fine work as Nicholson's brother in _The King of Marvin Gardens (1972)_ (qv) to establish a case that he was an underappreciated and underutilized talent. By the time Dern appeared as the cuckolded Marine in \"Coming Home,\" a consensus had emerged that Dern was a fine actor. He won an Oscar nod for the role, then fell victim to the infamous \"Oscar curse\" that has claimed other winners, most famously in the case of 1969 Best Supporting Actor winner 'Gig Young' (qv), Dern's co-star in _They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969)_ (qv).  Dern, like Young before him, was determined to break out of supporting roles. Like Young, who had been cast repeatedly as a light comedian in his career, Dern had also become typecast, but as a psycho, surpassing even 'Anthony Perkins (I)' (qv) in those types of roles. Dern was determined to break out of the ghetto he had found himself in before \"Coming Home.\" He failed, and his career suffered.  Up through his Oscar nomination, Dern had starred in 26 films in 11 years since graduating to steady employment in A-pictures with _Waterhole #3 (1967)_ (qv). After the 1979 Oscar nod, he would appear in only a dozen feature films in the next 11 years, not counting TV movies. None of them brought him stardom or much acclaim, and his attempt at becoming a lead man, _Middle Age Crazy (1980)_ (qv), flopped badly (he did received a nomination for Best Performance by a Foreign Actor at the 1981 Genie Awards, the Canadian equivalent of the Oscars, for his work in that picture). It was back to psychos, this time as a lead, in _Tattoo (1981)_ (qv). The movie proved to be another flop, and his reputation was further damaged when he bragged that he had actually performed on-screen sexual intercourse with co-star 'Maud Adams' (qv), a boast that Adams heatedly denied. Dern's star was seriously dimmed.  Although he landed a coveted role in the film adaptation of 'Jason Miller (I)' (qv)'s Pulitzer Prize-winning play _That Championship Season (1982)_ (qv), the film was a disappointment with critics and at the box office. He turned in a fine performance three years later in the TV movie _Toughlove (1985) (TV)_ (qv), but overall, his career was floundering.  Another psycho role, that of Uncle Bud in _After Dark, My Sweet (1990)_ (qv), started buzz about another possible Best Supporting Oscar nod for him, but the film proved a box-office bust and the nomination never materialized. A predicted career renaissance for Dern faded, just as the careers of his ex-wife, 'Diane Ladd' (qv), and their daughter, 'Laura Dern' (qv), kicked into high gear.  Since the 1990 high point of the second wave of his career, Dern has stayed steadily employed, but has never again generated much critical acclaim, nor made any inroads towards reclaiming his crown as the cinema's premier sociopath. A fine actor, who will be remembered most vividly for such psycho/killer roles such as the rustler leader who gunned down 'John Wayne (I)' (qv) in _The Cowboys (1972)_ (qv), Dern's career serves as a cautionary tale for those actors who try to escape the ghetto of typecasting. While nothing restricts an actor's artistic development as much as typecasting, unless like a Duke Wayne they can turn that type into superstardom, trying to break out of the type can prove to be career suicide.",

Kevin David Sorbo was born in Mound, Minnesota, on September 24, 1958. In high school, the \"Sorbs\" excelled at football, baseball and basketball; in college, he played these 3 sports, plus hockey. Kevin was also in a number of plays. After leaving college, Kevin joined an actors theater group, and traveled to Europe, then to Sydney, Australia appearing in commercials. At the end of 1986, he settled in Los Angeles. Kevin began to make guest appearances on such popular shows as _\"Murder, She Wrote\" (1984)_ (qv). At 6' 3\" and very muscular, Kevin was a natural for the title role in what would become his signature series _\"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys\" (1995)_ (qv). Kevin became internationally famous, and he learned the craft of film-making well enough to direct and co-write some of the episodes. Kevin even studied martial arts in order to do many of his own stunts. In real life, Kevin's heart is as big as Hercules'-- he leads \"A World Fit for Kids!\" as the chair and spokesperson. Kevin devotes much of his time to \"A World Fit For Kids!\" which is a successful mentoring model that trains inner-city teens to use school, fitness, sports and positive role models for themselves, and then become the coaches and mentors for younger children. In 1998, Kevin married lovely actress 'Sam Jenkins (I)' (qv), best known for her dual role on _\"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys\" (1995)_ (qv) as Serena/the Golden Hind (\"Hind\" is a female red deer).",

                "info": "Born December 16, 1964 in Scottsdale, Arizona; Thurane's father was a Burmese immigrant and his mother is of German-Irish descent. His mother sang him lullabies at bedtime and many were Christian spirituals. Thurane took piano lessons, struggled with the violin, sang in choir and played the baritone horn in concert band throughout grade school and junior high. He was introduced to the guitar and rock-n-roll through Elvis Presley albums his parents had, forming his first rock bands The Purple Platters and The Golden Pacers with friend Paul Cooley. Mesmerized by the Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Boston, Van Halen and the popular music of the 80s, Thurane rejected his peers' witness for Christ and formed various secular rock groups during high school including Malice and No Respect. Playing bars, parties and high school functions, he simultaneously achieved straight As in jazz lab in high school receiving a soloist award at the Arizona State jazz competition. He showed promise early on as an accomplished musician and guitarist. Thurane moved from hard rock and metal guitar influences to rockabilly. \"The roots of rock-n-roll come from Elvis, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, Gene Vincent, Bill Haley, The Burnette Brothers, Eddie Cochran and the Do-Wop groups. The British Invasion is an extension of that music, taking it to the next level. Cream, Hendrix and Led Zeppelin took it further still,\" says Thurane.  His first professional achievement was the recording of a 45 rpm single She's My Baby b/w Goin' To Alaska, playing guitar on it with rockabilly artist Tim Evans. He also backed legendary Phoenix rockabilly artist Elgin Macmillan from 1984-1987. While pursuing an intense desire to create music, Thurane left home at eighteen. The pressures of earning a living and working with uncommitted musicians forced Thurane to return home, which inspired his first steps towards God and a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. That time was 1987, when in July Thurane prayed to receive Jesus as his personal Lord and Savior. Two years later he briefly returned to secular music, co-founding Led Zeppelin stylized group Nowhere Fast. As he studied the bible and learned about discipleship, Thurane learned about total spiritual commitment in all areas of life. Leaving the band and taking a sabbatical from the music industry, he was baptized in September of 1989. Rick Schell of Campus Crusade for Christ discipled Thurane. They focused on prayer, fasting, church activities and serving God in various outreaches and homeless aid programs. Thurane ran sound and assisted with supporting the artists who sang at his church, avoiding performance. However, motivated by a need for a music minister at his church, Thurane led worship services for the small congregation at Camelback Community Church.  By 1992, inspired by the energy of hymns, inspirational, praise and worship and adult contemporary Christian music, Thurane played guitar with ministries Seeds of Salvation (SOS) and His Destiny. Douglas Scott Doiron asked him to play guitar and produce his \"Winds of Change\" EP. During that time Thurane secured his first publishing contracts. He also laid down tracks for what later became the first New Jerusalem CD, and finalized additional publishing and distribution arrangements.  Returning to secular music for a brief time, he played guitar with Arizona rock legend Michael Nitro in 1993. They opened for notable artists Gin Blossoms, Rick Springfield and Gerry Riopelle. A notable appearance at the 98 KUPD radio station event \"U-Fest\" in Arizona was featured at the famous Compton Terrace outdoor arena.  Still desiring to establish a Led Zeppelin stylized Christian band, Thurane established New Jerusalem with Randall James Householder as vocalist in 1994. After releasing 1995 EP \"Foundation\" and 1996 independent CD \"New Jerusalem\", he signed their first record deal with Gray Dot/Bulletproof Music in 1997. Selling respectably and reaching hard rock fans, their song \"Take Me Home\" reached #32 on the Christian rock charts and is included in the ABC made-for-TV movie \"What We Did That Night\"/\"Murder At Devil's Glen\" featuring \"NYPD Blue\" star Rick Schroeder and Tara Reid of \"American Pie\". \"Take Me Home\" is published by DSM Producers/Warner/Tamerlane. \"Living In the Light\" reached #11 on the Christian Loud Chart. New Jerusalem is unique in that a special NJ trading card from the Cactus Game Design game Redemption is featured exclusively in the New Jerusalem CD; and NJ music is included in the CDROM game Saints of Virtue. \"Con Express\" features NJ song \"Final Stand\", penned by Thurane and stars Sean Patrick Flanery (\"Simply Irresistible\") and Arnold Vosloo (\"The Mummy\"). The band performs throughout Arizona and nationally, currently working on an international distribution campaign. Moving into Adult Contemporary, Inspirational and Praise & Worship music in 1999, Thurane formed Kenyon Grey with Kenn Long (from Phoenix group Destiny). They signed a deal with RCM Records, owned by Rudy Morales of King David, a national progressive rock group based in Phoenix. The first Kenyon Grey single \"Heaven In Your Eyes\" charted in the top 100 at the CCMA and is to be featured in \"A Fairy's Tale\", screenplay written by Kenn. After marrying and becoming a stepfather in 2001, Thurane prayed and did a lot of soul searching concerning a solo career. He felt led by God to establish a solo music ministry, praising God in song with music inspired by Him. Thurane lives with wife Renada and stepson Torrey in Phoenix, Arizona. He loves spending time with his wife and stepson, watching movies and working out. Thurane also likes to spend time in prayer and worship with an appreciation of art and music.
