He knew early on that he wanted to be a film maker, but was held back, when his father was injured in 1976 and his mother went to work full time. Struggling to get by in southern California's turbulent market in the late 70's the family moved to Yuma Arizona in 1980. Robert began writing, encouraged by Deane Creamer-Close, a teacher, this new creative outlet became Robert's passion and he soon began to impress his teachers and friends with his stories. He also discovered a love for theater and in high school, and was active in Drama. At age 15 he performed in Tennessee Williams \"The Long Goodbye\" in the lead role. His performance got the attention of Professor of Theater and Speech at Arizona Western College, Gerald Giss. In 1991 Robert attended AWC on a full theater scholarship, and performed in more than a dozen shows over the next four years. Roles included; Bob Cratchet \"A Christmas Carol\" , Jud Fry \"Oklahoma\", Stanly Jerome \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\" and Charles Dalrimple \"Brigadoon\". After his father passed away from complications of prostate cancer in 2002, Robert determined to take his creativity to the next level. He enrolled at the Art Institute of LasVegas. Beginning in the animation program and then switching to visual effects, he achieved a B.S. Degree in Visual Effects and Motion Graphics in 2007. Returning to Yuma in 2008 to be closer to family, Robert Contacted Charles Pisaeno, and in 2010 they produced the indie suspense thriller Renovation.",

The son of an engineer, he majored in physics at California State University but, after graduating, drove a truck to support his screenwriting ambition. He landed his first professional film job as art director, miniature-set builder, and process-projection supervisor on 'Roger Corman' (qv)'s _Battle Beyond the Stars (1980)_ (qv) and debuted as a director with _Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1981)_ (qv) the following year. In 1984, he wrote and directed _The Terminator (1984)_ (qv), a futuristic action-thriller starring 'Arnold Schwarzenegger' (qv), 'Michael Biehn' (qv) and 'Linda Hamilton (I)' (qv). It was a huge success. After this came a string of successful science-fiction action films such as _Aliens (1986)_ (qv), _The Abyss (1989)_ (qv) and _Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)_ (qv). In 1990, Cameron formed his own production company, Lightstorm Entertainment. In 1997, he wrote and directed _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), a romance epic about two young lovers from social classes who meet on board the famous ship. The movie went on to break all box office records and earned eleven Academy Awards. It became the highest grossing movie of all time. The rest is history. James Cameron is now one of the most sought-after directors in Hollywood. He was formerly married to producer 'Gale Anne Hurd' (qv), who produced several of his films. In 2000, he married actress 'Suzy Amis' (qv), who appeared in Titanic, and they have three children.",

Actually, 2010 was a big studio picture and Dune was a high-end independent film. But these were mega-buck movies and Terminator just steam rolled over them.

Since then, the ideas and stories have grown seeing the science fiction film 'Never Forget the Brave' (a cutaway from the Lost Transmission concept) filmed in 2011/12 with his largest cast and crew to date, 2 more short films linked to Lost Transmission are in development 'Vengeance of the Fallen' and the Earth based 'Terra Conflict'  In 2010, Rick's small production company went Limited in the UK, involving his wife, Ruth, who also happens to be the Catering Manager for the company.  Sometimes under scrutiny for his working ethics, Rick is adamant he will continue to treat all his cast and crew as an equal, no matter what experience level they might be at, to him everyone is valuable in making the film come to life",

                "info": "Justin Murphy is a graduate of Jacksonville University and the founder of the production company Omega Theatre Productions. He began his producing and directing career on the stage with a highly successful production of Jesus Christ Superstar at the Florida Theatre in 1999, where he starred in the title role opposite Delisco, winner of E! Network's reality show The Entertainer.  His first passion has always been art and when he was only 17 he wrote, illustrated and published his first comic book series titled Southern Blood. The book received national distribution with Diamond Comics and continued to be published until Justin graduated from college in 1998.  His writing partnership with composer Roger Butterley began in 1994 when the two collaborated on concept music for the musical Eagle Song. Six years later they would complete the show and record a full symphonic recording that starred Delisco and Jamie Lynn Sigler. In 2002 Justin wrote a rock opera with Butterley called Fallen Angel and produced and directed the theatrical DVD version two years later. In 2006, Fallen Angel was accepted into the New York International Fringe Festival where it won the award for Most Outstanding Musical.  Returning to comics, Murphy wrote and illustrated \"Cleburne: A Graphic Novel\". After its publication from Rampart Press in December 2008, \"Cleburne\" went on to win the Book of the Year Award by ForeWord Magazine. The property is now in development for a film adaptation.",

                "info": "Jay Baruchel was raised in Montreal, QC Canada. He has a younger sister who also acts. He started acting in 1995 when he made his first of three appearances on the hit show _\"Are You Afraid of the Dark?\" (1991)_ (qv). He was also in more localized shows such as _\"My Hometown\" (1996)_ (qv) and _\"Popular Mechanics for Kids\" (1997)_ (qv).  Baruchel had spent some downtime and finally got a chance to be in a classic film called _Almost Famous (2000)_ (qv) in 2000. He played \"Vic\", a devout fan of 'Led Zeppelin' (qv). 'Judd Apatow' (qv) soon had a show in the works and Baruchel played \"Steven Karp\" on _\"Undeclared\" (2001)_ (qv). He also had the chance to star alongside actors such as 'Ian Somerhalder (I)' (qv) and 'James Van Der Beek' (qv) as \"Harry\" in _The Rules of Attraction (2002)_ (qv). Things began to slow down a bit after a couple more failed shows.  Soon enough, Baruchel came back as the courageous \"Danger Barch\" in _Million Dollar Baby (2004)_ (qv). Bringing life to a role that could have been ruined so easily, Baruchel made \"Danger\" a well-loved character. The best part about this actor is his loyalty to his home country. He loves to be able to work in Canada as often as possible. He has been in many fantastic independent films such as _Fetching Cody (2005)_ (qv), _Just Buried (2007)_ (qv) and _Real Time (2008)_ (qv). All three of those films appeal to sides of a person that are never known to exist until it's too late.  He was also in many successful American comedy films. He was the lead in _She's Out of My League (2010)_ (qv) and played one of 'Seth Rogen' (qv)'s best friends (which he really is) in the movie _Knocked Up (2007)_ (qv). He's also made his mark in family-friendly films such as _How to Train Your Dragon (2010)_ (qv), playing the unlikely \"Viking Hiccup\" and also played the title role in _The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010)_ (qv) alongside his newly-found kindred spirit, actor 'Nicolas Cage' (qv).  It is no secret that while he enjoys acting, it truly is a means to an end. He is currently living his dream as he works on the hockey comedy _Goon (2011)_ (qv) and is working on many other films that are what he considers to be passion projects. Now he is making films that he has been preparing for all of his life and nothing can slow him down.",

While working as an assistant animator and layout artist for Hinton Animation Studios in Ottawa, Ontario, DeBlois simultaneously attended Sheridan College's three year Classical Animation program. Upon graduation in 1990, DeBlois was immediately hired by Don Bluth Studios in Dublin, Ireland. There, he cut his teeth as a layout artist, character designer, and storyboard assistant to Don Bluth on such films as \"Thumbelina\" and \"A Troll in Central Park.\" In 1994, DeBlois left Ireland to work for Walt Disney Feature Animation as a storyboard artist, where he soon replaced his frequent collaborator, Chris Sanders, as Head of Story on \"Mulan.\" Shortly thereafter, they re-re-teamed to create the lush and whimsical \"Lilo & Stitch,\" heralded by critics as Disney's last great hand-drawn film. Following its release in 2002, DeBlois sold several original live action feature projects to write, direct, and produce, including \"The Banshee and Finn Magee,\" \"The Lighthouse,\" and \"Sightings,\" set-up at Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Universal Studios respectively. At present, all three remain in development. 2007 unveiled DeBlois' first foray into documentary filmmaking, with the acclaimed feature length music film, \"Heima,\" chronicling the homecoming concert odyssey of Iceland's famed post-rock phenomenon, Sigur Rós. In October of 2008, DeBlois returned to feature animation to co-write and co-direct Dreamworks then-troubled \"How To Train Your Dragon,\" once again re-teaming with Sanders. The two re-envisioned the story from scratch, leading the production to its March, 2010 release, at break-neck speed. The resulting film earned Dreamworks Animation its highest critical acclaim to date and became the studio's top grossing film outside of the \"Shrek\" franchise. During this same time, DeBlois also directed another feature-length music film for Sigur Rós front-man Jónsi, entitled \"Go Quiet,\" as well as a feature length concert film entitled \"Jónsi: Live at The Wiltern.\" At present, DeBlois is writing, directing, and executive producing the highly anticipated sequel to \"How To Train Your Dragon,\" which he describes as \"the epic second act of a much larger story.\"",

Noah started his way to stardom in commercials (in which he began to appear at age three). In 1978, he landed the role of Boxey on the cult Sci-Fi show, _\"Battlestar Galactica\" (1978)_ (qv). Later that year, he played the role of Atreyu in _Die unendliche Geschichte (1984)_ (qv) and the lead as Harry Potter Jr. in _Troll (1986)_ (qv). He taught advanced jazz and street dance in his late teens until an injury forced him to quit at 18. Afterwards, he studied Muay Thai boxing and then fought as an amateur. Noah then stayed out of the limelight until 1992 for the drama _To Die, to Sleep (1994)_ (qv).  Prior to moving back to LA in 1998, he lived in New York for two and a half years. In his spare time, he tries to get out to the track at Willow Springs, California, to race in Super Sport motorcycle racing. He has tended bar at several LA clubs and has several tattoos. He holds black belts in Tang Soo Do and Shotokan, and is currently learning American Kenpo from Dr Jerry Erickson, and he also helps him teach \"a close-quarter combat-training course for flight attendants and pilots for the airlines.\"",

When Dante's prophecized kingship turns out to be part of a much larger and more sinister scheme, the young elf's future as king goes from being the stuff of dreams to that of an unavoidable nightmare. As events unfold, Dante begins to change into something scheming and wicked, and the hero who once swore to love and protect him now finds himself vowing to stop him at all costs. Monsters from the fantasy genre abound in the form of goblins, trolls, dwarves, elves, and more in this dark re-imagining of the age-old \"boy who would be king\" tale. While the tone is at times dark and grim, there are still precious moments of humor, humanity, and a sense of wonder at a world far more fantastic than our own.",

                "info": "James Duval was born in the Midwest then, in 1970, moved with his family to Alaska by driving the Alcan Highway through Canada in a station wagon with fourteen people. He was raised in Fairbanks where he spent most of his younger years reading, writing and playing the violin. After graduating high school, he spent a year and half working with the Spanish speaking community of East Los Angeles, as a volunteer for the LDS Church.  James has been driven by the desire to create for as long as his parents can remember. From theater, road shows, writing and music he has spent most of his life being a creator and encouraging others to do the same.  In 1991 he moved to San Francisco to make movies. While at San Francisco State, he met Mark Lillig and the two of them decided to step away from a film education and into the actual practice of making movies. In 1996, they formed Independent Image Entertainment (IIE) with Tyler Ross and Richard Scott.  In 2004, after working on a project entitled Wrestling Days, two young filmmakers Danny Torres and Scott Hayman joined the IIE team. In late 2005 James Duval, Danny Torres, Scott Hayman, Mark R. Lillig, Tyler Ross and Richard Scott formed Continuum Pictures in Los Angeles.  Since the formation of Continuum Pictures, James Duval has produced many features, including Mano a Mano, Three Bad Men, Convict, The Absents, and others here in the US and internationally.  Through his experiences in life, James has been given the patience, time and opportunity to fall in love with movies and the people who make them while always giving credit to those films and people who inspired him.",

                "info": "Danny Torres  Though too young to be part of the \"Jaw's Baby\" generation of filmmakers, Danny Torres grew up still highly influenced by the films of Steven Spielberg, and considers himself part of the new generation of \"Jurassic Park Baby\" filmmakers. Born in Los Angeles, California to Salvadoran immigrants, Danny attended Loyola High School while still finding time to go to the movies every weekend with his father. Upon graduating, Danny moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to attend the University of California at Berkeley.  At the age of twenty, while still in college, Danny began working as a PA on a production with the indie film company Independent Image Entertainment (IIE). Approximately two weeks into production, based on the level of work and effort Danny was contributing to the production, the partners of IIE decided to make him a producer on the project and formally invited him to join the company. By the end of that year, Danny was voted in as the head of IIE by its nine partners, most of which were above the age of twenty-five. The following year, Danny supervised the release of all of IIE's productions and produced two more features by the time he graduated college.  At the beginning of 2006, Danny moved back to Los Angeles, along with six partners from IIE and formed a new company called Continuum Pictures, whose purpose was to produce studio-level projects. Since then, Danny has directly worked on numerous feature films, award-winning short films, and music videos. Danny's filmmaking experiences during that time have ranged from handling preproduction as a producer to being on set as a writer/director; he even became Continuum Pictures' most coveted cinematographer. Once the camera stops rolling, Danny often times finds himself in the editing room, either cutting a feature himself or assisting other editors in polishing their final edits.  As a writer, Danny has written three feature screenplays and worked as a script-doctor on numerous scripts, most of which have been green-lit based on his contributions.  Danny is now regularly consulted and has been instrumental in the formation of several smaller production companies, including Filmplane Entertainment. He strives to make every project begin with an \"A\" level script, no matter its genre or budget. A driven filmmaker, Danny's goal is to make the highest quality films for the widest audience possible.",

                "info": "Marc began studying acting at age 6 appearing on Sigmund and the Sea Monsters. At the age of 10, Marc, joined the local Jewish Community Center workshops. His first scene was from Sweet Charity and he was hooked on musical theater. The following 8 years included continued Summer Stock musical performances, plays and founding his High Schools Drama Club. Upon acceptance into UC Irvine's Theater Department he came down with meningitis and had a brush with death. On the verge of losing his life and then beating the illness, it was goodbye college and off to the Hollywood grind. Studying with various singing, acting and dancing coaches he set out to be a triple threat. Pounding the pavements, audition after audition, bit parts, B-movies, cable movies, commercials, public service announcements, plays, musicals and tons of rejections. He began writing and decided that if anyone was going to turn him down for a part again, it would be, him. Driven by his thirst to create and produce, in 1992, he went back to school and earned his Juris Doctrate Degeree and became an Attorney so that he could earn enough money to produce the plays and films he was writing. In 1999, along with his life-long friend, Dave Cohen, they opened Res Ipsa Productions and produced the first play he wrote, Terminal. He then went on to re-write Terminal for the screen, and they produced the Award-Winning film Terminal. Marc has been nominated and won several awards for his work on Res Ipsa films, Commute, Grappling with your Demons and most recently was awarded the Golden Halo Award from the Southern California Motion Picture Council for his performance in Falling Down. Marc is in production on several projects with Ford Austin, including, Zebra Room and Guns, Hookers and a Pound of Coke",

After having his first acting role in 1996, Todd's skills in fighting and agility were recognized and he was discovered as Jean Claude van Damme's stand-in and stunt double, but also his close friend. Todd got his second big acting part as J.C. Croissant in the hilarious Kung Phooey!, which is obviously a Van Damme parody.  Todd is now gaining fame as being one of the better stunt men and also a great all-round athlete who enjoys football, baseball, basketball, tennis, bowling, golf, archery and his family.",

Denise grew up feeling equally comfortable both in European and North American cultures and considers both Spanish and English to be her \"first languages\".  While studying piano and ballet as a child, Denise discovered early on that she had a passion for acting and at age 12 began to attend acting classes.  At age 16, she was discovered by the top modeling agency in Spain, Traffic, and quickly signed by other international agencies including Ford in NYC. She became to appear in International fashion magazines, such as Vogue, Glamour, Marie Claire and Jalouse.  In 2005, during her first summer working in Paris, Dior representatives taken by the singular beauty of her face offered her a contract for the DIOR cosmetics campaign of Spring/Summer 2006. Denise continues to model under the name Denise Sommers.  Her first break came through a role in Manolete (2008) the film starring Oscar nominated Penelope Cruz and Oscar winner Adrien Brody. The intimate scene with the two awarding winning actors served as Denise's entry into the world of celluloid.  Denise studied Acting at ESAD,(Academy of Dramatic Arts) in Madrid, and Drama and Theatre Studies at Trinity College Dublin.  While still engaged in international film productions, Denise is currently based in London working in theatre and film.  In Spring 2012 she performed in \"The Oresteia\" by Aeschylus directed by Anastasia Revi (TheatreLab Company) at Riverside Studios, London, where she caught the attention of several theatre critics.",

                "info": "Jon Lee Brody was born and raised in the Northwest Suburbs of Chicago. His father of German and Jewish decent and his mother of Korean decent, worked as a civil engineer and business consultant, respectively. Jon attended William Fremd High School where he excelled as a three sport athlete and also excelled academically. His aspirations were to be a professional athlete and like many kids in Chicago he wanted to 'be like Mike'. During high school, Jon was also a Golden Gloves boxer, an avid Martial Artist (he is a second degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do) and also was in the schools' symphony orchestra where he played the violin.  Jon went on to play football at the University of Illinois. However in his sophomore season, Jon suffered an injury that ultimately ended his playing career. He stayed in school and graduated in May of 2007 with a dual degree in Accounting and Finance. Jon was accepted for admissions to prestigious law schools like Harvard and Northwestern, but he instead chose to go against the grain and pursue his other childhood dream: acting. He didn't wait long to buy a one way ticket to Los Angeles, and since then he hasn't looked back.",

Most people don't know, but when I'm not shooting Big Time Rush, I am producing movies. In the past few years I have produced a pilot called \"Small Business\" for Comedy Central Digital, I was a producer on the Twilight spoof movie \"Breaking Wind\" for Lionsgate, and most recently I produced \"30 Nights of Paranormal Activity with the Devil Inside the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" which got distribution by 20th Century Fox. While making these films I have always run into the same problem when it comes to hiring animals. It's incredibly costly on a small budget to afford to have a dog on set, let alone a zebra. That is why I started Independent Film Animals. This company will help directors and producers get the vision that have worked so hard to achieve without going bankrupt. Our company will provide a wide range of animals for new projects. Whether you need Camels to ride in the desert, Otters to swim in your pool, Pigs to ride in your car or a Kangaroo to sit at your desk, I.F.A. will make your dreams a reality.",

                "info": "Highly inventive U.S. film director/producer/writer/actor Sam Raimi first came to the attention of film fans with the savage, yet darkly humorous, low-budget horror film, _The Evil Dead (1981)_ (qv). From his childhood, Raimi was a fan of the cinema and, before he was ten-years-old, he was out making movies with an 8mm camera. He was a devoted fan of 'The Three Stooges' (qv), so much of Raimi's film work in his teens, with good friends 'Bruce Campbell (I)' (qv) and 'Robert G. Tapert' (qv), was slapstick comedy based around what they had observed from \"Stooges\" movies.  Among the three of them, they wrote, directed, produced and edited a short horror movie titled _Within the Woods (1978)_ (qv), which was then shown to prospective investors to raise the money necessary to film _The Evil Dead (1981)_ (qv). It met with lukewarm interest in the U.S. with local distributors, so Raimi took the film to Europe, where it was much more warmly received. After it started gaining positive reviews and, more importantly, ticket sales upon its release in Europe, U.S. distributors showed renewed interest, and \"Evil Dead\" was eventually released stateside to strong box office returns. His next directorial effort was _Crimewave (1985)_ (qv), a quirky, cartoon-like effort that failed to catch fire with audiences. However, he bounced back with _Evil Dead II (1987)_ (qv), a racier and more humorous remake/sequel to the original \"Dead\" that did even better at the box office. Raimi was then given his biggest budget to date to shoot _Darkman (1990)_ (qv), a comic book-style fantasy about a scarred avenger. The film did moderate business, but Raimi's strong visual style was evident throughout the film via inventive and startling camera work that caught the attention of numerous critics.  The third chapter in the Evil Dead story beckoned, and Raimi once again directed buddy Campbell as the gritty hero \"Ash\", in the Gothic horror _Army of Darkness (1992)_ (qv). Raimi surprised fans when he took a turn away from the fantasy genre and directed 'Gene Hackman' (qv) and 'Sharon Stone (I)' (qv) in the sexy western, _The Quick and the Dead (1995)_ (qv); four years later, he took the directorial reins on _A Simple Plan (1998)_ (qv), a crime thriller about stolen money, starring 'Bill Paxton' (qv) and 'Bridget Fonda' (qv). In early 1999, he directed the baseball film, _For Love of the Game (1999)_ (qv), and, in 2000, returned to the fantasy genre with a top-flight cast in _The Gift (2000)_ (qv). In 2002, Raimi was given a real opportunity to demonstrate his dynamic visual style with the big-budget film adaptation of the 'Stan Lee (I)' (qv) comic book superhero, _Spider-Man (2002)_ (qv), and fans were not disappointed. The movie was strong in both script and effects, and was a runaway success at the box office. Of course, Raimi returned for the sequel, _Spider-Man 2 (2004)_ (qv), which surpassed the original in box-office takings.  Raimi remains one of Hollywood's most creative, exciting and intelligent filmmakers.",

He was born Daniel Wroughton Craig on March 2, 1968, at 41 Liverpool Road, Chester, Cheshire, England. His father, Tim Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, then became landlord of \"Ring O' Bells\" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia Craig, was an art teacher. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel Craig was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of 6, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv)'s _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.  At the age of 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral, UK. He left Hilbre High at 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as \"Agamemnon\" in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director 'Edward Wilson (I)' (qv). He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside 'Ewan McGregor' (qv) and 'Alistair McGowan' (qv), then later 'Damian Lewis (I)' (qv) and 'Joseph Fiennes' (qv), among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of 'Colin McCormack (I)' (qv), the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named 'Ella Craig' (qv), was born in 1992. Daniel Craig made his film debut in _The Power of One (1992)_ (qv). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial _\"Our Friends in the North\" (1996)_ (qv). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in _Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)_ (qv) and _Road to Perdition (2002)_ (qv). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in _Layer Cake (2004)_ (qv), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray \"James Bond\", in October of 2005, weeks after he finished his work in _Munich (2005)_ (qv), where he co-starred with 'Eric Bana' (qv) under the directorship of 'Steven Spielberg' (qv).  Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool \"007\". He is the first blonde actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author 'Ian Fleming (I)' (qv) in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: 'Sean Connery' (qv), 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv), 'Timothy Dalton' (qv) and 'Pierce Brosnan' (qv) have indicated that Craig is a good choice as \"Bond\".",

He took to writing while schooling in Kitzbuhel, Austria, and upon failing the entrance requirements for Foreign Service joined the news agency Reuters as a journalist -- winning the respect of his peers for his coverage of a \"show trial\" in Russia of several Royal Engineers on espionage charges. Fleming briefly worked in the financial sector for the family bank, but just prior to the Second World War, was recruited into British Naval Intelligence where he excelled, shortly achieving the rank of Commander. When the war ended, Fleming retired to Jamaica where he built a house called \"Goldeneye,\" took up writing full-time and created the character that would make him famous -- British Secret Service agent James Bond, in a novel called \"Casino Royale.\" Fleming spent the rest of his life writing and traveling the world, but as his Bond character reached new heights of popularity on movie screens, Fleming was in ailing health. He died of a heart attack (his second) in England in August 1964 at the age of 56.",

Ben attended Samuel Whitbread Community College where his interest in theatre grew and he became a member of the Bancroft Players Youth Theatre at Hitchin's Queen Mother Theatre. During his time there he rose to prominence in many productions, most notably If This Is a Man, based on the book of the same name by 'Primo Levi' (qv), a survivor of Nazi World War II prisoner of war camp. The play was taken to the Edinburgh Festival in 1995 where it garnered five-star reviews and great critical acclaim with Ben Whishaw getting rave reviews for his portrayal of Levi. Ben then enrolled in, RADA from where he graduated in 2004 and soon landed the role of Hamlet in 'Trevor Nunn' (qv)'s 2004 production making him one of the youngest actors to portray Hamlet on-stage. Hamlet opened to rave reviews with many critics hailing Ben as the next 'Laurence Olivier' (qv) and applauding his portrayal of Hamlet with leading critics haling the birth of a star. Whishaw's film and TV credits include _Layer Cake (2004)_ (qv) and 'Christopher Morris (I)' (qv)' 2005 sitcom _\"Nathan Barley\" (2005)_ (qv), in which he played a character called Pingu. He was named \"Most Promising Newcomer\" at the 2001 British Independent Film Awards (for _My Brother Tom (2001)_ (qv)) and, in 2005, nominated as best actor in four award ceremonies for his Hamlet. He also played 'Keith Richards (II)' (qv) in the 'Stephen Woolley' (qv) biopic _Stoned (2005)_ (qv). Whishaw played in _Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (2006)_ (qv) as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, a perfume maker whose craft turns deadly getting raves once again for his stunning portrayal. Whishaw appeared in 2007's _I'm Not There (9999)_ as one of the 'Bob Dylan' (qv) reincarnations and in 2008 in _\"Criminal Justice\" (2008)_ (qv) a TV series.

                "info": "She is one of the entertainment industry's most successful female producers. Barbara Broccoli was born to legendary filmmaker 'Albert R. Broccoli' (qv), affectionately known as Cubby, and 'Dana Broccoli' (qv) on June 18, 1960. Not long after, Cubby Broccoli and his new partner, 'Harry Saltzman' (qv), secured studio backing for an ambitious series of films inspired by the popular James Bond novels written by 'Ian Fleming (I)' (qv).  Ms. Broccoli grew up in the behind-the-scenes world of James Bond, traveling with her family around the world to various exotic locations. As a child, she liked to play with the photocopy machines in the offices of Eon Productions, Ltd., her father's company responsible for the Bond films. During location shooting in Japan for _You Only Live Twice (1967)_ (qv), young Barbara caught a fever from the Japanese custom of sleeping on the floor. 'Sean Connery' (qv), whose star status provided him with a comfortable bed, generously relinquished it so Barbara could properly fight her illness.  She graduated from Loyola University in Los Angeles, California with a degree in motion picture and television communications. Her first official credited job on the Bond films was for 1983's _Octopussy (1983)_ (qv) in which she served as an executive assistant. But, as with any family business, one helps out where one can. For instance, in her father's autobiography \"When The Snow Melts\", she recalls a nightmarish situation involving _A View to a Kill (1985)_ (qv) star 'Grace Jones (I)' (qv). Later, for the two 'Timothy Dalton' (qv) Bond films, she was promoted to associate producer, a post she shared with veteran Bond associate producer 'Tom Pevsner' (qv).  The August 8, 1990 issue of Variety (weekly) reported that aging Cubby Broccoli had turned control of Eon Productions Ltd. over to Barbara and her half-brother, 'Michael G. Wilson (I)' (qv) (Dana's son, who had been an invaluable help to Cubby and the Bond franchise in various capacities since the mid-1970s). Due to some unfortunate business dealings with then-MGM ownership (the studio that bankrolled Bond and held significant interest in the series), production of the Bond films was put on what would become a six year hiatus.  When the litigation was settled, \"Bond 17\" (eventually named _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv)) was on track and Barbara Broccoli, now a full producer alongside 'Michael G. Wilson (I)' (qv), was faced with the challenge of bringing Bond back to the big screen. She has earned a reputation as being tough when she has to be and for volunteering for the toughest jobs, such as overseeing the Russian location unit. _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) was a world-wide smash, and each of the succeeding Bond films were also enormously popular. This is a testament to the talent of Cubby Broccoli, who passed his knowledge of high-stakes film production on to Michael and later Barbara. The benefit of Cubby's experience is obvious when viewing the newest Bond films starring 'Pierce Brosnan' (qv).  Her non-Bond producing credits include _Crime of the Century (1996) (TV)_ (qv), which deals with the murder trial from the famous Lindberg kidnapping, and the popular London Stage production of \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\", which was co-produced by her mother 'Dana Broccoli' (qv) and half-brother 'Michael G. Wilson.' Both productions carried a personal interest for Ms. Broccoli. Charles Lindberg was her father's favorite hero, and \"Chitty\" was adapted from the film produced by her father, which was based upon the children's novel by 'Ian Fleming (I)' (qv).",

From here, Harris won roles in various projects, such as _\"Simon and the Witch\" (1987)_ (qv) and _\"The Tomorrow People\" (1992)_ (qv). She went on to study social and political sciences at Pembroke College, Cambridge University, an experience Harris did not enjoy.  After graduating from University, Harris trained at Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. Acting success soon followed and her breakthrough film role came in 'Danny Boyle' (qv)'s _28 Days Later... (2002)_ (qv). Other notable projects include _Miami Vice (2006)_ (qv) and _Small Island (2009) (TV)_ (qv) (for which she was named best female actor by the Royal Television Society). Harris also won fans for her role as Tia Dalma in the blockbusting \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" films and further international attention came her way when she was cast as Field Agent Eve in the twenty third James Bond film, _Skyfall (2012)_ (qv).",

The story he wrote in 1971 for \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" concerned Peter Parker's friend Harry Osborne having a bad trip on LSD and nearly dying from it. The Comics Code Authority declared that they would not give their seal of approval to the three-issue arc on the grounds that the code, which was notorious for being draconian, would not allow the depiction of drug use even when it is portrayed negatively. Confident that the original government request would give him credibility and with the support of his publisher, Martin Goodman, Lee decided to defy the CCA and published the story as is without the seal and received healthy sales and a positive public reaction for his efforts in portraying the social problem. Soon after, the CCA changed their rules to allow for anti-drug messages in comics.",

                "info": "Harrison Ford was born on July 13, 1942 in Chicago, Illinois. His father was Irish, his mother Russian-Jewish. He was a lackluster student at Maine Township High School East in Park Ridge Illinois (no athletic star, never above a C average). After dropping out of Ripon College in Wisconsin, where he did some acting and later summer stock, he signed a Hollywood contract with Columbia and later Universal. His roles in movies and television (_\"Ironside\" (1967)_ (qv), _\"The Virginian\" (1962)_ (qv)) remained secondary and, discouraged, he turned to a career in professional carpentry. He came back big four years later, however, as Bob Falfa in _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). Four years after that, he hit colossal with the role of Han Solo in _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv). Another four years and Ford was Indiana Jones in _Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)_ (qv).  Four years later and he received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for his role as John Book in _Witness (1985)_ (qv). All he managed four years after that was his third starring success as Indiana Jones; in fact, many of his earlier successful roles led to sequels as did his more recent portrayal of Jack Ryan in _Patriot Games (1992)_ (qv). Another Golden Globe nomination came his way for the part of Dr. Richard Kimble in _The Fugitive (1993)_ (qv). He is clearly a well-established Hollywood superstar. He also maintains an 800-acre ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.",

It's not a thrill thing or an adrenaline rush; it's engaging in a process that takes focus and commitment. I love the machines, I love the aviation community. I used to own airplanes and have pilots flying them for me, but I finally realized they were having more fun than I was. They were getting to play with my toys. I was 52 when I started flying - I'd been an actor for 25 years and I wanted to learn something new. Acting was my only identity. Learning to fly was a lot of work, but the net result was a sense of freedom and a pleasure in seeing to the safety of myself and the people who fly with me. All of my planes are great to fly, and that's why I've got so many of them. I have a Citation Sovereign, a long-range jet; a Grand Caravan, a turboprop aircraft capable of operating on unimproved strips; and a De Havilland, a bush plane. I have a 1929 Waco Taperwing open-top biplane; a 1942 PT-22 open-top monoplane trainer; an Aviat Husky, a two-seat fabric-covered bush plane; and a Bell 407 helicopter. I also have more than my fair share of motorbikes - eight or nine. I have four or five BMWs, a couple of Harleys, a couple of Hondas and a Triumph; plus I have sports touring bikes. I'm a single rider, and I love being out in the air. I like the focus that comes when you're riding - you really have to be very keyed into what you're doing.

                "info": "George Walton Lucas, Jr. was raised on a walnut ranch in Modesto, California. His father was a stationery store owner and he had three siblings. During his late teens, he went to Downey High School and was very much interested in drag car racing. He planned to become a professional racecar driver. However, a terrible car accident just after his high school graduation ended that dream permanently. The accident changed his views on life. He decided to attend Modesto Junior College before enrolling in the University of Southern California film school. As a film student, he made several short films including THX-1138: 4EB (Electronic Labyinth) which won first prize at the 1967-68 National Student Film Festival. In 1967, he was awarded a scholarship by Warner Brothers to observe the making of _Finian's Rainbow (1968)_ (qv) which was being directed by 'Francis Ford Coppola' (qv). Lucas and Coppola became good friends and formed a company called American Zoetrope in 1969. The company's first project was Lucas' full-length version of _THX 1138 (1971)_ (qv). In 1971, Coppola went into production for _The Godfather (1972)_ (qv), and Lucas formed his own company, Lucasfilm Ltd. In 1973, he wrote and directed the semi-autobiographical _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv) which won the Golden Globe and garnered five Academy Award nominations. This gave him the clout he needed for his next daring venture. From 1973 to 1974, he began writing the screenplay for _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv). He was inspired to make this movie from Flash Gordon and the Planet of the Apes films. In 1975, he established ILM (Industrial Light and Magic) to produce the visual effects needed for the movie. Another company called Sprocket Systems was established to edit and mix Star Wars and later becomes known as Skywalker Sound. His movie was turned down by several studios until 20th Century Fox gave him a chance. Lucas agreed to forgo his directing salary in exchange for 40% of the film's box-office take and all merchandising rights. The movie went on to break all box office records and earned seven Academy Awards. It redefined the term \"blockbuster\". The rest is history. Lucas made the other Star Wars films and along with 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) created the Indiana Jones series which made box office records of their own. From 1980 to 1985, Lucas was busy with the construction of Skywalker Ranch, built to accommodate the creative, technical, and administrative needs of Lucasfilm. Lucas also revolutionized movie theaters with the THX System which was created to maintain the highest quality standards in motion picture viewing. He went on to make several more movies that have created major breakthroughs in filmmaking. He is chairman of the board of The George Lucas Educational Foundation. In 1992, George Lucas was honored with the Irving G. Thalberg Award by the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his lifetime achievement.",

I don't think there's a great deal of discrimination -- although I'm completely perplexed and confused as to why there aren't more women. For instance, if we're looking for new, young directors, which is something we do all the time, we certainly never go look at films because they're directed by a man or a woman. We look at films because they are winning awards, they're good, and it has nothing to do with gender. And women certainly have equal opportunity to get into a university like UCLA or USC, to get into the film department, to take the same courses to allow them to make films, to deal with a whole gamut of subject matter, and yet I don't know what happens. There's something that happens in the process of getting there that seems to turn many women away.",

A short music career preceded his academic exploits at the University of Oregon and Harvard, after which he began a lucrative tenure as an Executive Recruiter in New York until one of his early loves in life, performing, drew him away from the corporate world.  Mr. Emmert has performed on stage and in numerous independent and studio films, as well as in television series and specials. He is a Big Four repped screenwriter and independent film producer. Emmert also served as Program Director for Encore Entertainment's Creative Theatre Group Summer Camps for Film and Theatre in 2003, prior to incorporating Invictus Films in 2004. He has directed several music videos (most recently for The Replacements/Soul Asylum/Guns N Roses bassist Tommy Stinson), and written and produced numerous historical documentaries for cable television.  Alexander Emmert wrote, produced and directed \"The Judas Kiss\", which was the Grande Premiere Event at the Monaco International Festival of Film; co-produced and directed \"Between Us, Love\", which is headlining the Urban World 2010 Festival in New York City, and was Assistant Producer and Assistant Director of \"Elle: A Modern Cinderella Tale\", which won Best Family Feature at the Newport Beach Films Festival in 2010.  While continuing to perform in front of the camera and on the stage, Mr. Emmert's producing and screenwriting career have taken flight. He works on both US coasts and in Europe, and is hopeful of expanding Invictus Films' coproductions into Asia and Australia in 2011 and beyond. He lives with his dog Raja in both Los Angeles and Philadelphia at varying times of year.",

The story details Noor's life from her birth in 1914 in Moscow to an American mother and an Indian Muslim father who founded the first Sufi Order in the West, through to her death at the hands of the Gestapo in 1944.",

Abrams' (qv) (who knew that his then-15-year-old son was a big 'John Carpenter (I)' (qv) fan). Abrams told Gross that during the discussion afterward, Gerald suggested cutting an opening sequence in which Snake tries to rob a bank and is caught, on the principle that Snake seems like a more imposing, mythic, tougher character if you don't see him defeated right away. Young J.J. suggested making it clearer that 'Adrienne Barbeau' (qv)'s character Maggie dies at the end. Both suggestions were followed in the final cut: the opening scene was deleted, and a shot was added showing Maggie's body.",

Nonetheless, this sensitive, deeply religious youngster who was born in July 1962 in Syracuse, New York, was destined to become Tom Cruise, one of the highest paid and most sought-after actors in screen history. The only son (among four children) of nomadic parents, young Tom spent his boyhood eternally on the move, and by the time he was 14, had attended 15 different schools in the US and Canada. He finally settled in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, with his mother and her new husband. While in high school, he developed an interest in acting and abandoned his plans of becoming a priest, and at age 18 headed for New York and a possible acting career. The next 15 years of his life are the stuff of legends. He made his film debut with a small part in _Endless Love (1981)_ (qv) and from the outset exhibited an undeniable box office appeal to both male and female audiences. Within 5 years Tom Cruise was starring in some of the top grossing films of the decade including _Top Gun (1986)_ (qv); _The Color of Money (1986)_ (qv), _Rain Man (1988)_ (qv) and _Born on the Fourth of July (1989)_ (qv). By the 1990s and 2000s he was one of the highest paid actors in the world earning an average 15 million dollars a picture in such blockbuster hits as _Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994)_ (qv), _Mission: Impossible (1996)_ (qv), _Mission: Impossible II (2000)_ (qv), _Mission: Impossible III (2006)_ (qv), _Vanilla Sky (2001)_ (qv), _Minority Report (2002)_ (qv), _The Last Samurai (2003)_ (qv), _Collateral (2004)_ (qv), _War of the Worlds (2005)_ (qv), and _Jerry Maguire (1996)_ (qv) - for which he received an Academy Award Nomination for best actor. In 1990 he renounced his devout Catholic beliefs and embraced The Church Of Scientology claiming that Scientology teachings had cured him of the dyslexia that had plagued him all of his life. A kind and thoughtful man well known for his compassion and generosity, Tom Cruise is one of the best liked members of the movie community. He was married to actress 'Nicole Kidman' (qv) until 2001. Thomas Cruise Mapother IV has indeed come a long way from the lonely wanderings of his youth.",

Redstone said the firm terminated its deal with Cruise due to the under-performance of _Mission: Impossible III (2006)_ (qv) (which had been expected to gross $100-150 million more than it did), which he attributed to Cruise's \"bad behavior\". Movie pundits were somewhat surprised by the announcement, as Cruise remains the top B.O. draw in North America and was Paramount's cash cow. Cruise's films reportedly have accounted for 32% of Paramount Pictures' revenues in the last six years, and he was named the Top Box Office draw for a record 7th time by Quigley Publications for the year 2005. As part of its machinations before severing its connections with Cruise, Paramount leaked to the press the information that the deal was worth $10 million annually; however, the development deal actually was for $3 million per annum. At the time of the announcement, Cruise and his advisers were considering Paramount's new offer of $2 million per year in development money when Redstone dropped his bombshell. The news gave rise to speculation that Paramount has run out of cash as it reportedly has told other development partners with which it has deals to use their own cash for the rest of the year, with the proviso they will be reimbursed come 2007.",

Then I met 'Sydney Pollack' (qv). I was 19 or 20. He was editing _Tootsie (1982)_ (qv), and I'd just finished _Risky Business (1983)_ (qv). I got a meeting with Sydney that was supposed to be 20 minutes and ended up being over two hours. Outside of my admiration for him as a filmmaker, we talked about a big mutual interest that we had in aviation because I knew he flew. Sydney became a lifelong friend, and when we finished _The Firm (1993)_ (qv) together in 1993 or 1994, he gave me flying lessons as a gift. He said, \"I know how much you love flying. Take the time, right now, and do it, because otherwise you'll never get to it\". I had two kids by then, and I worked all the time. In a few months, I had my instrument rating and, a little while after that, I had my commercial rating. I trained mostly in aerobatics, because I wanted to fly the P-51. I was doing rolls, loops, all kinds of aerobatic maneuvers. My first airplane was called a Pitts, and then I flew a Marchetti. That's a third-world air force trainer they use in the Navy's TOPGUN schools for air-to-air combat. This was all in preparation to fly the Warbird, the P-51. I searched all over the world for my P-51 and found it in 2000. It's called \"Kiss Me Kate\", which covers two things I love most, my wife and movies.",

                "info": "Jeremy Lee Renner, son of Valerie and Lee, was born in Modesto, California. After a tumultuous yet happy childhood with four younger siblings, Renner graduated from Beyer High School and attended Modesto Junior College. He explored several areas of study, including computer science, criminology, and psychology, before the theater department, with its freedom of emotional expression, drew him in.  However, Renner recognized the potential in acting as much through the local police academy as through drama classes. During his second year at Modesto Junior College, Renner role-played a domestic disturbance perpetrator as part of a police-training exercise for an easy $50. Deciding to shift his focus away from schoolwork, Renner left college and moved to San Francisco to study at the American Conservatory Theater. From there he moved to Hawaii and, in 1993, to Los Angeles.  In Los Angeles, Renner devoted himself to theater, most notably starring in and co-directing the critically acclaimed \"Search and Destroy.\" He pursued other projects during this time as well, landing his first film role in 1995's _Senior Trip (1995)_ (qv). After several commercials and supporting roles in television movies and series, Renner captured the attention of critics with his gripping, complex portrayal of the infamous serial killer in the 2002 film _Dahmer (2002)_ (qv). Renner's performance, which earned him an Independent Spirit Award nomination, is especially remarkable for painting a humane and sympathetic, yet deeply disturbing, portrait of the title character.  In 2003, Renner took a break from small indie films to work on his first commercially successful movie, _S.W.A.T. (2003)_ (qv), with 'Colin Farrell (I)' (qv). In 2005, he played the leading role in _Neo Ned (2005)_ (qv) as an institutionalized white supremacist in love with a black girl, winning the Palm Beach International Film Festival's best actor award. Renner's pivotal supporting roles in 2005's _Twelve and Holding (2005)_ (qv) and _North Country (2005)_ (qv) earned him accolades from critics, and his 2007 turn in _Take (2007)_ (qv) garnered him the best actor award at California's Independent Film Festival. Also in 2007, Renner played a leading role in the horror film _28 Weeks Later (2007)_ (qv) as well as a supporting role in the underrated Western epic _The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)_ (qv), with 'Casey Affleck' (qv), 'Brad Pitt' (qv), and 'Sam Rockwell' (qv).  Renner's depiction of Jeffrey Dahmer in 2002 caught the attention of director 'Kathryn Bigelow' (qv), and, in 2008, she cast him in his most famous role as Sergeant First Class William James in _The Hurt Locker (2008)_ (qv). Renner's performance as a single-minded bomb specialist scored him an Academy Award nomination for best actor. He also earned best actor nominations from the Independent Spirit Awards, the Screen Actors Guild, and the BAFTA Awards, as well as wins in this category from several film critics groups.  In 2009, Renner starred in the short-lived TV series, _\"The Unusuals\" (2009)_ (qv), and in 2010 he played the chilling but loyal criminal Jem in 'Ben Affleck' (qv) bank-heist thriller _The Town (2010)_ (qv). In the fall of 2010, Renner began filming _Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011)_ (qv), scheduled for release in 2011.  Renner's strengths as an actor derive not only from his expressive eyes but also from his ability to thoroughly embody the characters he portrays. His visceral depiction of these individuals captivates audiences and empowers him to steal scenes in many of his films, even when playing a minor role. Renner gravitates toward flawed, complicated, three-dimensional characters that allow him to explore new territory within himself.  In addition to his work as an actor, Renner continues to cultivate his lifelong love of music. A singer, songwriter, and musician, he performed with the band Sons of Ben early in his career. Scenes in _Love Comes to the Executioner (2006)_ (qv), _North Country (2005)_ (qv), and _The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)_ (qv) briefly showcase Renner's singing talents.  Despite traveling the world for film roles and, recently, as a United Nations Goodwill Peace Ambassador to raise awareness for mine-clearing efforts in Afghanistan, Renner remains close to his roots. In 2010, Modesto Junior College presented him the Distinguished Alumnus award in recognition of his body of work as an actor. He also headlined at a benefit for Modesto's Gallo Center for the Arts in the fall of 2010.  Renner maintains a sense of humility and gratitude, even in the wake of his recent successes and recognition. He keeps himself grounded by renovating and restoring old and rundown iconic Hollywood homes, an enterprise he began back in his early days in Los Angeles. He values loyalty and a sense of both age and history, and enjoys the opportunity to help conserve these qualities in a town that favors the young and the new.",

Irving \"Ving\" Rhames had studied dramatic arts at the New York High School of Performing Arts and then at the Julliard School of Drama. After graduating from Julliard, Rhames went on to perform in Shakespeare in the Park productions. In 1984, he appeared in front of the camera's for the first time in the TV movie _\"American Playhouse\" (1981) {Go Tell It on the Mountain (#4.5)}_ (qv), and was then quickly cast in minor roles in several popular TV shows including _\"Miami Vice\" (1984)_ (qv), _\"Tour of Duty\" (1987)_ (qv) and _\"Crime Story\" (1986)_ (qv). In a remarkable turn of events, whilst filming _The Saint of Fort Washington (1993)_ (qv) in New York, he was introduced to a homeless man, who turned out to be his long lost, older brother, Junior, who had lost contact with the family after serving in Vietnam. The thrilled Rhames immediately assisted his disheveled brother in getting proper food & clothing, and moving him into his own apartment.  His next big break came in 1994 when director 'Quentin Tarantino (I)' (qv) cast him as the merciless drug dealer Marsellus Wallace in the mega hit _Pulp Fiction (1994)_ (qv). Not long after, director 'Brian De Palma' (qv) cast Rhames alongside 'Tom Cruise' (qv) as the ace computer hacker, Luther Stickell in _Mission: Impossible (1996)_ (qv). With solid performances in both these highly popular productions, his face was now well known to movie goers, and the work offers began rolling in more frequently.  The next career highlight was playing the lead role in the HBO production of _Don King: Only in America (1997) (TV)_ (qv). Rhames' performance as the world's most infamous boxing promoter was nothing short of brilliant, and at the 1998 Golden Globe Awards he picked up the award for Best Actor in a MiniSeries. However, in an incredible display of compassion, he handed over the award to fellow nominee 'Jack Lemmon' (qv), as he felt Lemmon was a more deserving winner!  The talented actor then contributed attention grabbing performances in _Bringing Out the Dead (1999)_ (qv), returned as Luther Stickell in _Mission: Impossible II (2000)_ (qv), contributed his deep bass voice for the character of Cobra Bubbles in _Lilo & Stitch (2002)_ (qv), and played a burly cop fighting cannibal zombie hordes in _Dawn of the Dead (2004)_ (qv). A keen fitness & weight lifting enthusiast, Rhames is also well known for his strong spiritual beliefs and benevolent attitude towards other people.",

                "info": "Paula's family lived across the street from the 20th Century Fox lot when she was growing up and she was a fan of films from her earliest years. Her mother, who also appreciated good films, was a schoolteacher, and her father was a lawyer. Paula claims that as a girl she would escape by \"pretending to be someone else\" so it was not a surprise that she acted in high school plays at Hamilton Magnet Arts High School. Her favorite role was that of \"Abigail\" in \"The Crucible\". However, she went on to study film at the University of Southern California in a summer program, and won a 3-month assignment making documentaries for PBS. This led to her working as a production assistant for TV documentaries, and also for 'Howie Mandel (I)' (qv)'s talk show. She progressed to actually producing documentary segments for _\"Medical Diaries\" (2000)_ (qv) airing on Discovery Health Channel. Paula now professes that she liked what she was doing, but her dream remained the same as when she was small so she took acting lessons and shifted gears to become a performer. She was almost immediately successful and, within three years, had played parts in major features, _Hitch (2005/I)_ (qv) and _Idlewild (2006)_ (qv) and the female lead in _Deja Vu (2006)_ (qv) opposite 'Denzel Washington (I)' (qv).",

During his tenure there, he was awarded the James Pendelton Award for Acting and was a finalist for the prestigious Irene Ryan Award given by the Kennedy Center. Upon graduation he immediately started working as an actor and was awarded a fellowship from the USC School of Theater to teach acting during the summer session (at twenty-two, he's the youngest person to ever receive this honor). Named by Variety as one of their \"Top Ten Screenwriters to Watch\" of 2007, his debut script 'Recount' was voted number one on the Hollywood Blacklist for 2007. The film aired on HBO in 2008 with an all-star cast and was hailed by the Los Angeles Times as 'the best political thriller since 'All The Presidents Men.'\" It garnered 11 Emmy nominations (including Best Writing), 5 Golden Globe nominations and won the Emmy for Best TV Movie. Strong also received the Writers Guild of America Award for the script.  As an actor, he has an impressive resume with extensive credits in film, television and theater that includes classic movies and TV shows like \"Pleasantville\", \"Seabiscuit\", \"Seinfeld\", \"Nip/Tuck\" and \"Third Rock from the Sun\". He is best known for the five years he played \"Jonathan Levinson\" on the landmark television series \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" for which he was named \"One of the Top Ten Scene Stealers on Television\" by the San Francisco Chronicle. He is also widely recognized for his four seasons as \"Doyle\" on the beloved WB show, \"Gilmore Girls.\"",

It's costly and cumbersome and keeps audiences from access to many worthy films. So, in my opinion, avoiding the traditional model is a win. In many ways, multifaceted release makes sense from an economic standpoint. For one thing, advertising budgets have more bang for the buck when theatrical release campaigns lead directly into DVD release. Under the old model, filmmakers are never quite sure how distributors are treating their baby, and it's critically difficult to accurately monitor earnings. Of course, it's going to take time to see just how well the new distribution models really work. Meanwhile, I, as someone involved in the business and as an audience member who just loves movies, am a believer.",

His doctors believed he would live a short, meaningless life, if he survived at all. Morris had different plans... What Morris had was his mind, and his faith that one day he would walk out on his own two feet, and make a full recovery, no matter what his doctors told him. Using the same step-by-step, goal-oriented approach he took in his career, Morris began to calculate the steps he needed to make toward recovery. He set a goal to be home by Christmas of that same year. He succeeded before Thanksgiving, just eight months after the accident.",

The Comics Code Authority declared that they would not give their seal of approval to the three-issue arc on the grounds that the code, which was notorious for being draconian, would not allow the depiction of drug use even when it is portrayed negatively. Confident that the original government request would give him credibility and with the support of his publisher, Martin Goodman, Lee decided to defy the CCA and published the story as is without the seal and received healthy sales and a positive public reaction for his efforts in portraying the social problem.

Since then, the ideas and stories have grown seeing the science fiction film 'Never Forget the Brave' (a cutaway from the Lost Transmission concept) filmed in 2011/12 with his largest cast and crew to date, 2 more short films linked to Lost Transmission are in development 'Vengeance of the Fallen' and the Earth based 'Terra Conflict'  In 2010, Rick's small production company went Limited in the UK, involving his wife, Ruth, who also happens to be the Catering Manager for the company.  Sometimes under scrutiny for his working ethics, Rick is adamant he will continue to treat all his cast and crew as an equal, no matter what experience level they might be at, to him everyone is valuable in making the film come to life",

                "info": "Benny Andersson was born in 1946 outside of Stockholm, Sweden. His father and grandfather both being musicians, Benny was introduced to the accordion at an early age. With little patience for conventional music lessons, Benny is known to pick up just about any instrument and play it with ease. After he left high school, he was invited to become a part of the popular Swedish beat group 'The Hepstars' (qv), with whom he played for several successful years until the band disbanded in the late 1960s. While touring with the band, he met another young songwriter named 'Björn Ulvaeus' (qv), and the two released their own LP after the breakup of 'The Hepstars' (qv). They were soon joined by their girlfriends, 'Anni-Frid Lyngstad' (qv) and 'Agnetha Fältskog' (qv), in a touring act \"Festfolket\", which was not much of a success. This foursome would, however, find international stardom and astounding success under the moniker 'ABBA' (qv). During his years with 'ABBA' (qv), Benny co-wrote and co-produced the band's entire output as well as touring the world. After the band split he, along with Björn, wrote the music for 'Tim Rice (I)' (qv)'s \"Chess\", which was a huge success. In recent years, Benny has divided his time between producing (for such successful Swedish performers as 'Josefin Nilsson' (qv)) and his love for birds. More success followed with the premiere of he and Björn's latest musical, \"Kristina från Duvemåla\". Several concerts celebrating the contribution he and Bjorn have made to the music industry in Sweden have been staged in 1998.",

He followed in his father's footsteps working for IBM in Georgia, but on a dare from friends, he did a few minutes of comedy at an Atlanta comedy club. A few months later, Foxworthy quit his job and started on the stand-up comedy road. His comedy originally centered on family situations, but he soon hit upon his successful \"You might be a redneck if...\" tagline, which he says signifies \"a glorious absence of sophistication.\" Following two successful albums, Foxworthy joined the growing trend of stand-up comics with their own TV sitcoms.",

He received two nominations for his original portrayal of Dr. Frasier Crane on _\"Cheers\" (1982)_ (qv), another for his guest appearance in that role on _\"Wings\" (1990)_ (qv), and nine nominations (earning four awards) as Outstanding Actor for his work on _\"Frasier\" (1993)_ (qv). Over the years, Dr. Frasier Crane has become one of television's most endearing and enduring characters. In addition to his Emmys, Grammer has won two Golden Globe Awards, two American Comedy Awards and a People's Choice Award for his portrait. Grammer's distinctive voice has been heard in several hit animated features, including the voice of \"Stinky Pete\" in Disney's hit _Toy Story 2 (1999)_ (qv) and a part in _Anastasia (1997)_ (qv). On television, he has also been seen in several mini-series and movies. In 1996, he hosted an hour-long salute to 'Jack Benny' (qv) for which he served as executive producer. He also starred in HBO's award-winning _The Pentagon Wars (1998) (TV)_ (qv).  Born in St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, Grammer was raised by his mother and grandfather in New Jersey and then Florida. After his grandfather's death, Grammer was drawn to the works of 'William Shakespeare (I)' (qv) and spent two years at the prestigious Juilliard School. He then dove into the world of regional theater, eventually making the leap to Broadway with roles in \"Macbeth\" and \"Othello.\" He joined the cast of _\"Cheers\" (1982)_ (qv) in 1984. His autobiography, \"So Far\", was published in fall 1995.",

[Laughs.] When I first came onto \"Cheers,\" it was originally only going to be for seven shows. Apparently, I was funny enough to keep around. They said that to me quite openly. \"He's funny enough to keep around. He makes things funny that we didn't think were funny, and that's an asset to the show.\" So they found a way to have him be part of it. ... You know, one of my favorite episodes of playing Frasier on \"Cheers\" was one I think was called \"The Triangle,\" when he actually started to do therapy on Sam and Diane and sort of ended up examining himself in the process, and had the big blowout in Sam's office with the two of them. He sort of became his own man at that point, and I liked that. It was a good episode. And it was probably also when he realized he could have his own show. [laughs]",

And it was [Paramount TV head] John Pike who was responsible for \"Frasier.\" He's the one who sat me down and said, \"I think a sitcom should be funny, and the script you guys turned in is not.\" [Laughs.] \"I want you to do \"Frasier.\"\" So I said, \"Okay, well, there's a couple of conditions: he's not married, and I don't want any kids in there.\" So we found the devices to get as far away from Boston as we could, and people made an attempt to make sure this was a new guy with an old but recognizable name. But he was still the centerpiece of the show, so we got David [Hyde Pierce] to be the Frasier of the show, and we were able to let Frasier be someone a little bit different.",

I hadn't followed X-Men so much, but when I played the role, I got so much response from people about how excited they were. I think there was just a gap in the market.

A greedy land developer, Norm Blandsford, has been buying up the little country town, running the hard working residents off their land. After Travis has a run-in with one of Blandsford's men, he is chased into the forest where he stumbles upon a magic portal to the hidden world where Paul Bunyan lives. Paul has been in self-imposed exile for 100 years, ever since the advent of machines made his role in society obsolete and left him feeling of little value to the new world. Paul, reluctantly, escorts Travis back to the farm. But upon returning,Paul witnesses Blandsford's sinister plan. Suddenly filled by a long-forgotten sense of purpose, Bunyan and Babe, the blue ox, get wrapped up in a brand new adventure and together with the help of their new friends, Travis and Whitney, they save the town.

                "info": "Howy discovered a taste for acting at the age of 18 before leaving school. Already on his way to The University of Central Lancashire in 2004 to study Law with English Literature, Howy changed his mind during his first year and completed his University life with a BA Hons in Drama with Literature in 2007. Determined to take his acting to the next level, he started applying and auditioning for various Acting Schools in London, including the likes of RADA and LAMDA, but it was The International School of Screen Acting that really caught Howy's attention as it was an acting school dedicated to the medium of Film/TV acting. In 2009, Howy graduated from the International School of Screen Acting with a diploma in Screen Acting, after a one year post-graduate course. Howy doesn't just enjoy acting for film and TV, he also enjoys dabbling the boards a little, and proved this by taking part in 2010's Camden Fringe Festival in a play called 'Fox Girl Five' written by Eddie Coleman and directed by Amber Holmes. Howy was delighted to come on board with 'Laura J.' (qv) and 'Ginnie Watson' (qv) to be a part of 'I AM AN ACTOR', and to make his Actor/Writer/Director debut with _Schizophrenia and Me and Me (2011)_ (qv). Due to his enjoyment of writing scripts, Howy has joined forces with his long time friend, 'Pedro Del Battenberg' (qv), to create pH films. Howy signed with Marlowes Agency in 2010, and is now attached to two features, _Life Outside (2013)_ (qv) and _Fighting Back (2015)_ (qv). Howy plays a lead character, Teeth, in the new series, _\"Safelight 19\" (2012)_ (qv).",

                "info": "Born to a French mother and Martinican father, Alex was raised in the heart of central France. His father, a Vietnamese martial-arts instructor, initiated him into the arts at an early age. Alex soon became a star of the podiums, winning 3 times the title of champion of France in Viet Vo Dao between 1997 and 2000.  At 17 years old, while still following his sports studies, Alex also began to practice dance, Parkour (aka \"the Art of displacement, initially made popular by the Yamakasi, and later by its namesake film) and acrobatics.  This combination of moving arts led him to create a show combining sports, stunts and acting, with the proceeds benefiting children's education in Viet Nam.  His regional notoriety got him a place on the generic for the film Kiss of the Dragon with Jet Li. His role, while canceled at the last minute, sparked his decision to focus on his professional acting ambition and led him, over the course of three years, to play in two successful musical comedies. His performance was recognized and he was invited to study for two years at the International Academy of Acting, Singing and Dancing.  At the end of his training, Alex decided to transition from live acting to film. He completed film acting and English classes before officially auditioning as an actor from 2005. His chameleon like appearance associated with his incredible physical ability, have brought him a variety of professional experiences.  The famous international series, Galactik Football (2006 - 2008) taught him how to act in Motion Capture. He had roles in ten different Indian films between 2006 and 2010 during a stint in Bollywood. In France, Alex started his acting career in Banlieue 13 Ultimatum by Patrick Alessandrin and the highly acclaimed film The Prodigies by Antoine Charreyron (2011).  Between 2012 and 2013, Alex played in three French films: Rust and Bone by Jacques Audiart, starring Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts, The Lookoot by Michele Placido with Daniel Auteuil and Matthieu and Jeu De Couples by Maxwell A. Cavevall. He has also had roles in two American films: Battle of the year: Plaent B-Boy by Benson Lee, starring Josh Holloway and the singer Chris Brown and Fast and Furious 6 by Justin Lin, with Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson.",

Michael left school at 17 before graduating from Southampton Institute with a BA Honours in Business Management and Finance. Michael had a series of working class jobs before travelling the world aged 23. On that trip Michael had the time to allow his passion to flourish and upon returning to England in February 2007, Michael gravitated toward the film industry and started with the lead in award winning short film '8ight Limbs'(2008). In the years that followed Michael progressed with more leading and supporting roles and was compared to a young Michael Caine. This led to Michael's role in LA based feature The Summoning, securing Michael's O1 visa and SAG approval, a huge step for an aspiring actor in such a competitive industry. In 2010 Michael founded an apolitical grass-roots youth movement called 'Bite the Ballot' and from this has contributed to building a relationship between young people and parliament, inspiring young people to believe in the power of their voice and ultimately vote. This has been a rewarding project for Michael that comes hand in hand with his acting career as he finds the time to attract others to this worth while cause building the profile of the movement that is stretching across the UK and now has strong tie with the USA equivalent 'Rock the Vote'. Michael has enjoyed roles with repertory companies and directors and his reputation is becoming widely acclaimed.",

His score for Mooz-lum awarded him a Black Reel nomination.

But as she finished her degree, she also became more and more interested in acting, and, still with a strong interest in the psychology of her characters, she completed a three year Advanced Diploma in Method Acting, and was accepted onto a course at the internationally-renowned École Philippe Gaulier in Paris.  In 2004 Angela landed her first photographic role, becoming one of the faces of Suncorp Metway, and then later went on to work on television commercials for companies including Suncorp Metway, Holden and MTV. Her earliest movie role was being an extra in Gettin' Square starring Sam Worthington (while also working as the stand in for Freya Stafford).  In 2009 Angela became the popular face of the well-known Australian television show 'Queensland's Best Living' for a season before settling in London, where her acting career has really taken off with roles in award-winning festival films such as 'Tangled Up In Blue' (Dir: Haider Rashid, Best Film Award - I See Films 2010; cinema release in late 2010) and 'Egression' (Dir: Ray Brady).  As well as acting, Angela is also in development with her own screenplays, also writes a popular acting blog, and runs the UK branch of a cross-Atlantic actor networking programme.",

However, Tom's old neighbourhood is not as it once was and it is not very long when Tom ends up in a major altercation where he gets noticed! And by the wrong people! Tom thought that he had left War behind him in the military, but little did he know, his urban War was just about to begin!",

                "info": "Justin R. Durban was born in Memphis, Tennessee and raised in the small town of Madisonville, Kentucky. As a child, he spent most of his time dreaming of working in the movies in one aspect or another and was always creating his own music for his stop motion films. He always wanted to become an astronaut, tinkered with anything electronic like an inventor, and devised thousands of schematics and illustrations for future space travel. You could say Justin has always been an avid dreamer and levitates naturally to things beyond normal imagination.  Despite playing music all his life, Justin only took two years of piano lessons, and three years of trumpet back in Middle school. Both of which, he grew out of very quickly. Most of his music comes from the ability to hear by ear and he tends to play music that 'just sounds right'. His music can best be described as \"Upliftingly Dark\" Cinematic Film Music with hints of Epic Intimacy.  Justin's strong desire to work on anything involving films led him to pick up a keyboard, find some music software, and begin to write and score his own music for his own movie projects. He gained recognition by giving away his music to anyone that found a place for it within their films. Eventually those filmmakers are returning years later with bigger and better projects. Justin feels that his current success is contributed to a technological wonder called, 'The Internet'.  Justin's first major music achievement was first featured on the Warner Brothers film trailer, \"Taking Lives\", starring Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke. One of his first musical scores was the 35 mm film \"Firecracker\", which got accepted into the Raindance Film Festival in London, England of October, 2004. \"Firecracker\" later went on to win numerous awards and was named on Roger Ebert's list of 2005's best films. Since then, Justin has scored hundreds of shorts, several features, and various other multimedia projects. His music has won many awards along with numerous wins in film festivals all over the world.  Justin continues to write music for the boutique trailer music company, X-Ray Dog Music, located in Burbank. By writing orchestral music through X-Ray Dog, his music has been in recent campaigns such as; Warner Brothers, \"Harry Potter - Order of the Phoenix\", and Universal's \"HULK\", \"Mummy3\" and Sony's \"Stomp The Yard\" theatrical and TV trailers. He recently completed the feature film, \"Semum\" which was later picked up by Warner Brothers Turkey for international distribution. He also just wrapped the score to the critically acclaimed internet released film, \"Star Trek - Of Gods and Men\" directed by Tim Russ and the feature, \"InAlienable\" directed by Robert Dyke starring Walter Koenig, Richard Hatch, and numerous cast members to the Star Trek series old and new. His latest film score to the feature \"The Blackout\" directed by Robert Sanders of Starway Pictures. \"GPS - The Movie\" recently won Best Action Film at AOF Festival 2008. He resides in Los Angeles, California with his wife and baby boy further pursuing his filmmaking and film scoring career.",

But I will say a couple of things, and if you'll forgive me, I won't say anything further. One is that I didn't develop a drinking problem. I am one of those people who is built in such a way that I have, from the very beginning, an unfortunate relationship with alcohol. So there was never a good time for me to have a drink. Then there's one further thing I will say, but I'd rather not say anything further, just for reasons that we don't have to go into it. Not because I have any shame in this area; I'm a sober alcoholic, it's a perfectly respectable thing to be and I've made arrangements about it. But I will say that I used to drink and it was absolutely terrible, and now I don't drink and it's absolutely marvelous. And that's as much as I'd like to say. Thanks.",

With supporting turns in _The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2011)_ (qv), _Wrath of the Titans (2012)_ (qv) and _Total Recall (2012)_ (qv), 2012 was a busy year for Nighy.

At school he gained 'O'-levels in English Language and English Literature and enjoyed reading, particularly 'Ernest Hemingway' (qv). On leaving school he wanted to become a journalist but didn't have the required qualifications. He eventually went on to work as a messenger boy for the Field magazine. He stayed in Paris for a while because he wanted to write \"the great novel\", but he only managed to write the title. When he ran out of money, the British consul shipped him home. A girlfriend suggested that he should become an actor, so he trained at Guildford School of Dance and Drama. Since then he has found continuous work as an actor, on stage, screen and radio. His stage work includes National Theatre roles in Tom Stoppard's Arcadia in 1993, David Hare's Skylight and Blue Orange. Bill's partner was actress 'Diana Quick (I)' (qv) (he asked her to marry him but she said: \"don't ask me again\", he called her his wife because anything else would have been too difficult). They have a daughter, 'Mary Nighy' (qv), who is studying at university and contemplating an acting career. She has already began to appear on TV dramas and radio programs.",

                "info": "David Soul achieved pop icon status as handsome, blond-haired, blue-eyed Detective Kenneth Hutchinson on the cult \"buddy cop\" TV series _\"Starsky and Hutch\" (1975)_ (qv), Soul also had a very successful singing career recording several albums, with worldwide number one hit singles including \"Silver Lady\" & \"Don't Give Up on Us Baby\".  Born in Chicago, Illinois, David Soul is the son of a minister who was at one time serving as the religious affairs advisor to the U.S. High Commission in Berlin. At 24 years of age, young Soul joined a North Dakota musical revue, was noticed by a keen-eyed talent scout, and signed to a studio contract. He went on to study acting with the Irene Daly School of The Actors Company, and with the Columbia Workshop in Hollywood. He first appeared on TV in small roles in shows including _\"I Dream of Jeannie\" (1965)_ (qv), _\"Flipper\" (1964)_ (qv) and _\"All in the Family\" (1971)_ (qv). Regular TV work kept coming in for Soul including making masked appearances on _\"The Merv Griffin Show\" (1962)_ (qv), as the popular singer known only as \"The Covered Man.\"  In 1973, Soul was fortunate enough to be cast as one of the corrupt motorcycle cops in the 'Clint Eastwood' (qv) thriller _Magnum Force (1973)_ (qv), where his talents came to the attention of several TV execs who were looking for someone to play one of the lead roles in the upcoming _\"Starsky and Hutch\" (1975)_ (qv) TV series. After four seasons, the show came to an end, yet Soul's talents were still in demand. He quickly went on to appear as the meek writer turned terrified vampire hunter Ben Mears in the chilling television mini-series _Salem's Lot (1979) (TV)_ (qv), and then as Jake in the interesting television movie _Homeward Bound (1980) (TV)_ (qv).  Several undemanding movies and TV series appearances followed for Soul. However in 1988 he scored rave reviews for his portrayal of real life, cold-blooded cop killer Michael Lee Platt in _In the Line of Duty: The F.B.I. Murders (1988) (TV)_ (qv). It was considered highly controversial for its intense level of violence in a made for TV production.  David Soul remained very busy throughout the 1990's and beyond, in both film and on stage productions. He has toured internationally in several theater productions, including playing the narrator in the critically-acclaimed production of Willy Russell's Blood Brothers, plus a successful UK tour performing in Ira Levin's Deathtrap. Fans of the original TV series were glad to see Soul back with 'Paul Michael Glaser' (qv) doing a cameo appearance in the big-budget movie version of _Starsky & Hutch (2004)_ (qv).  Throughout his life, Soul has continually championed social causes often utilizing his own funds to raise awareness on issues including the impact of the Vietnam War, the shutdowns in the US steel industry, animal welfare, world hunger and HIV education. Soul has for several years made his home in the United Kingdom, where he has appeared at the Edinburgh Festival, on several British TV shows and has become a keen soccer fan supporting English club, Arsenal FC.",

Leading her community of nuns, Hildegard later writes three books of theology and two books of science, including the first treatises by a woman on feminine sexuality, as well as countless letters and two biographies. The first composer whose biography is known, Hildegard scribes over seventy-seven songs and poems, including the first form of an opera. She founds two Benedictine monasteries, celebrating education, beauty and art. Hildegard struggles to survive in the medieval world, facing challenging relationships with popes, kings and bishops. Her teacher and scribe, the loving monk, Volmar, shares with her an impassioned spiritual relationship. A story of love and triumph, both earthly and Divine.",

                "info": "Adam Goldworm was born in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. He left home with starry eyed dreams of fame and success in Hollywoodland. Not unlike countless others, he watched as his dreams were set ablaze. He never even bothered to pick up his diploma from UCLA's School of Film and TV. His breakthrough film, _Luckytown (2000)_ (qv), which at one point was among the five to watch at the 2000 Cannes Film festival, now awaits a handful more votes before it can attain its well deserved status on IMDb's list of the worst 100 films of all time.  At least they didn't steal his sense of humor along with his pride and his soul.  Broken and defeated, he traded the Hollywood Hills for the hills of Berkeley and embarked in pursuit of a pointless piece of paper... an MBA. Creatively suffocated by business school double-speak and non-profit obsessed hippies, Adam began teaching Intro to Film to Berkeley undergrads. After all of this, armed with the best state-subsidized business school education that money can buy and past production experience accidentally breaking break-away glass, he still couldn't find a job in Hollywood.  Soon enough, things began to improve. He landed a job answering phones at Industry Entertainment, a preeminent management production company. Goldworm quickly worked his way up the food chain; during his five year tenure, Goldworm climbed from underpaid assistant to underpaid executive, ultimately serving as Executive Vice President, TV. At the company, Goldworm demonstrated his keen eye for spotting new talent and managed the careers of several hot writers, directors and actors. He also became an involuntary, pseudo-Canadian citizen, having spent countless months in in various regions (and nether-regions) of Canada, producing several television series including Showtime's _\"Masters of Horror\" (2005)_ (qv), ABC's _\"Masters of Science Fiction\" (2007)_ (qv) and NBC's _\"Fear Itself\" (2008)_ (qv) , desperately trying (and ultimately failing) to create a new anthology as fresh and exciting as the \"Twilight Zone\" (1959) series that he admired so.  In 2009, Goldworm said goodbye to his various mentors at Industry Entertainment and left to start his own management/production business -- Aperture Entertainment. So far, so good...  Goldworm has no plans to change his name.",

Through no fault of her own she finds herself single, homeless and in desperate need to help her family survive its own financial and emotional crises. Known for her love of all things Jane Austen, Kate is given a freelance gig that changes everything: to research whether it is possible, in these modern times-and at a certain age-to marry well. What starts as an article quickly turns into Kate's real-life quest. From the polo fields of West Palm Beach to the glamour of London's social scene, Kate, who gets mistaken for an aristocrat, chases the man of her dreams, a charming and elegant older financier. But she keeps running into a brooding Englishman, Griffith Saunderson, who works at an impeccably Austenesque estate. Caught between Mr. Rich and maybe Mr. Right, Kate must choose what she really wants out of life: to marry for money or risk it all for love.",

                "info": "Joshua Louis Monkarsh (born December 21, 1978) is an American film producer. Monkarsh attended Beverly Hills High School in Beverly Hills California where he took advantage of the infamous stage production program. After graduation in 1997, Monkarsh attended the American University, where he studied International Business. Monkarsh also attended the New York film Academy at Universal Studios. Ironically, that same year - he was hired by 20th Century Fox as a courier.  In the summer of 2002, Monkarsh created Traffic City Productions, making his feature film debut - writing, directing and producing the coming of age drama: \"The Highlife\": which was awarded a prestigious Remi Award at the 36th Annual Worldfest Houston. 2005's \"Subway Cafe\" was boasted by a spectacular performance portrayed by Rick Gonzalez (War of the Worlds, Illegal Tender, Old School).  Monkarsh produced 2007's short: \"The Devil Wears a Toupee\" for the 2007 MTV Movie Awards - interactive competition. MTV Networks (us) added the film to their interactive programming schedule in early 2008. \"Fighter Pilot\" explores the life of nineteen-year-old Joseph Hirsch at New York University in 1941, who enlists after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. In October 2007, Fighter Pilot was distributed by the Independent Film Channel (IFC) (us) to air on their program: Media Lab.  In 2008, Monkarsh wrote, directed and produced the sci-fi/romance: \"The Evolution of Ethan Baskin\" starring Jason London (Dazed and Confused, The Man in the Moon). Upon completion, Monkarsh received acceptance from the 62nd annual Cannes Film Festival. In 2010, Monkarsh acted as an executive producer on the Indie feature: \"Cougars, Inc.\" starring James Belushi, Denise Richards, Sarah Hyland (Modern Family), and Kyle Gallner (A Nightmare on Elm Street).  In the summer of 2011, Josh Monkarsh joined forces with Palm Star Media Capital, as co-producer of \"Ian Fleming\" based on Fleming's WWII experiences which ultimately inspired the creation of James Bond. Monkarsh is also co-producing \"Lunar Park\" based on the best-selling Bret Easton Ellis novel and \"The Golden Suicides\" based on the Vanity Fair article chronicling Theresa Duncan and Jeremy Blake.  Drawing universal insight from the traditions of life, Monkarsh has established himself as a true innovator - producing films that explore narrative conventions while infusing the standard form with substance and depth.",

The setting was changed to Mars with the Precogs being people mutated by the Martian atmosphere, as established in the first film. The main character was also changed to Douglas Quaid, the man played by 'Arnold Schwarzenegger' (qv). The project eventually fell apart but the writers, who still owned the rights to the original story, rewrote the script, removing the elements from Total Recall (1990). This script was eventually tossed out when novelist 'Jon Cohen (I)' (qv) was hired in 1997 to start the project over from scratch. The only original element from the early script which made it to the final _Minority Report (2002)_ (qv) film is the sequence in the car factory, an idea that 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) loved.",

                "info": "Philip Kindred Dick was born in Chicago in December 1928, along with a twin sister, Jane. Jane died less than eight weeks later, allegedly from an allergy to mother's milk. Dick's parents split up during his childhood, and he moved with his mother to Berkeley, California, where he lived for most of the rest of his life. Dick became a published author in 1952. His first sale was the short story \"Roog.\" His first novel, \"Solar Lottery,\" appeared in 1955. Dick produced an astonishing amount of material during the 1950s and 1960s, writing and selling nearly a hundred short stories and some two dozen or so novels during this period, including \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,\" \"Time Out Of Joint,\" \"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,\" and the Hugo-award winning \"The Man In The High Castle.\" A supremely chaotic personal life (Dick was married five times) along with drug experimentation, sidetracked Dick's career in the early 1970s. Dick would later maintain that reports of his drug use had been greatly exaggerated by sensationalistic colleagues. In any event, after a layoff of several years, Dick returned to action in 1974 with the Campbell award-winning novel \"Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said.\" Perhaps more importantly, though, this same year Dick would have a profound religious experience that would forever alter his life. Dick's final years were haunted by what he alleged to be a 1974 visitation from God, or at least a God-like being. Dick spent the rest of his life writing copious journals regarding the visitation and his interpretations of the event. At times, Dick seemed to regard it as a divine revelation and, at other times, he believed it to be a sign of extreme schizophrenic behaviour. His final novels all deal in some way with the entity he saw in 1974, especially \"Valis,\" in which the title-character is an extraterrestrial God-like machine that chooses to make contact with a hopelessly schizophrenic, possibly drug-addled and decidedly mixed-up science fiction writer named Philip K. Dick. Despite his award-winning novels and almost universal acclaim from within the science-fiction community, Dick was never especially financially successful as a writer. He worked mainly for low-paying science-fiction publishers and never seemed to see any royalties from his novels after the advance had been paid, no matter how many copies they sold. In fact, one of the reasons for his extreme productivity was that he always seemed to need the advance money from his next story or novel in order to make ends meet. But towards the very end of his life, he achieved a measure of financial stability, partly due to the money he received from the producers of _Blade Runner (1982)_ (qv) for the rights to his novel \"Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?\" upon which the film was based. Shortly before the film premiered, however, he died of a heart attack at the age of 53. Since his death, several other films have been adapted from his works (incuding _Total Recall (1990)_ (qv)) and several unpublished novels have been published posthumously.",

It wasn't until 2006, while stationed at Holloman AFB in New Mexico that he was pulled back into acting, this time in front of a camera working for Michael Bay on \"Transformers\" (his first acting on film). Shortly after that, Fred deployed to Afghanistan working for 10th Mountain under a joint arrangement. After returning he separated from the service and relocated to Texas. He is the only actor to have been killed by both the Decepticons and Cobra on the big screen. He has worked in film as a producer, director and assistant director in addition to being an actor. He and his wife, Andrea (a writer and artist) have two children and presently reside in Texas.",

Coming from a very musical family, Michael McKnight held his own as an actor, model, singer, songwriter and musician; played Bass Guitar, Drums and Saxophone and also was an athletic standout in college as a Defensive Back in Florida until an ankle injury ended his promising football career. His athleticism, however, landed him in several Stunt Man roles for popular TV series programs such as \"Superforce\", \"NYPD Blue\", \"The Profiler\" and the first \"Blade\" film. Michael holds a Black Belt in Wado Ryu, an Okinawan self-defense style and continues to land athletic and stunt roles to date.  Michael's modeling career began with John Casablanca's Modeling Agency in 1983, then with Karati & Poletti Modeling in 1996 which led him to Italy, but has made Los Angeles his home since 1997. McKnight now has entered the writing and producing arena by launching an independent film production company based out of Los Angeles called M Squared Films, Inc.",

Miller started off small with multiple music videos and short films. In 2005 Miller attended and graduated Full Sail University.  In 2005, immediately after graduating film school at Full Sail University, Steven moved from Florida to Hollywood where he and two close friends raised the money to fund his feature film debut. \"Automaton Transfusion.\" The no-budget cult phenomenon (which Miller also wrote and edited) was shot in 9 days and had a budget of under 30k.  In October 2007, \"Automaton Transfusion\" premiered at the \"ScreamFest\" horror festival at the Mann's Chinese Theater. It was purchased and distributed by Dimension films.  Over the next several years, Steven was attached to several studio films including MGM's remake of \"Motel Hell,\" Paramount Vantage's \"Ink\" and \"Area 52\" that never materialized into actual films. He learned the meaning of \"development hell.\"  In 2011, Steven decided to return to his roots, work outside of the studio system and shot two independent low budget features: \"Under The Bed\" and \"The Aggression Scale.\"  The Amblin-esque \"Under The Bed\" premiered at the 2012 Fantasia Film Festival and played film festivals around the globe. \"The Aggression Scale\" premiered to rave reviews at the 2012 South By Southwest Film Festival and was described as \"Home Alone\" meets \"Straw Dogs\" and was purchased by Anchor Bay.  In April of 2012 Miller began shooting the remake of \"Silent Night, Deadly Night\" starring Malcolm McDowell and Jaime King. Anchor Bay is set to distribute in December 2012.",

                "info": "Adam Goldworm was born in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. He left home with starry eyed dreams of fame and success in Hollywoodland. Not unlike countless others, he watched as his dreams were set ablaze. He never even bothered to pick up his diploma from UCLA's School of Film and TV. His breakthrough film, _Luckytown (2000)_ (qv), which at one point was among the five to watch at the 2000 Cannes Film festival, now awaits a handful more votes before it can attain its well deserved status on IMDb's list of the worst 100 films of all time.  At least they didn't steal his sense of humor along with his pride and his soul.  Broken and defeated, he traded the Hollywood Hills for the hills of Berkeley and embarked in pursuit of a pointless piece of paper... an MBA. Creatively suffocated by business school double-speak and non-profit obsessed hippies, Adam began teaching Intro to Film to Berkeley undergrads. After all of this, armed with the best state-subsidized business school education that money can buy and past production experience accidentally breaking break-away glass, he still couldn't find a job in Hollywood.  Soon enough, things began to improve. He landed a job answering phones at Industry Entertainment, a preeminent management production company. Goldworm quickly worked his way up the food chain; during his five year tenure, Goldworm climbed from underpaid assistant to underpaid executive, ultimately serving as Executive Vice President, TV. At the company, Goldworm demonstrated his keen eye for spotting new talent and managed the careers of several hot writers, directors and actors. He also became an involuntary, pseudo-Canadian citizen, having spent countless months in in various regions (and nether-regions) of Canada, producing several television series including Showtime's _\"Masters of Horror\" (2005)_ (qv), ABC's _\"Masters of Science Fiction\" (2007)_ (qv) and NBC's _\"Fear Itself\" (2008)_ (qv) , desperately trying (and ultimately failing) to create a new anthology as fresh and exciting as the \"Twilight Zone\" (1959) series that he admired so.  In 2009, Goldworm said goodbye to his various mentors at Industry Entertainment and left to start his own management/production business -- Aperture Entertainment. So far, so good...  Goldworm has no plans to change his name.",

You're standing naked with all these alcoholics, getting a cold shower with a bar of soap the size of a quarter. Then you're given a blanket and a bunk, and you try to get some sleep in a room full of people with the worst gas in the world. All night they're farting and belching and coughing up blood. The next morning, you get your clothes back, but they all smell like booze and shit. And then you listen to proselytizing while choking back melba toast and canned orange juice.

I was like, \"Oh...my...God.\" From that moment on I was done with police work. The girls in theater arts were so much prettier. I changed the course of an entire life based on the libido of an 18-year-old boy. During my first acting class, I did a scene with a girl-a girl I'd never met before-and we were supposed to be making out on a park bench. I was really hesitant about it, but she attacked me. She wasn't just kissing me, she was deeply tonguing me, arms and hands everywhere. I was so flummoxed, I forgot my lines. Afterward, I was thinking, I need to ask this girl out; she's obviously really into me. So during the break, I asked her if maybe she wanted to go out sometime, get some lunch or dinner.

                "info": "'Guillermo del Toro' (qv) was born October 9, 1964 in Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico. Raised by his Catholic grandmother, del Toro developed an interest in filmmaking in his early teens. Later, he learned about makeup and effects from the legendary 'Dick Smith (II)' (qv) (_The Exorcist (1973)_ (qv)) and worked on making his own short films. At the age of 21, del Toro executive produced his first feature, Dona Herlinda and Her Son (1986). Del Toro spent almost 10 years as a makeup supervisor, and formed his own company, Necropia in the early 1980s. He also produced and directed Mexican television programs at this time, and taught film.  del Toro got his first big break when _Cronos (1993)_ (qv) won nine academy awards in Mexico, then went on to win the International Critics Week prize at Cannes. Following this success, del Toro made his first Hollywood film, _Mimic (1997)_ (qv), starring 'Mira Sorvino' (qv).  del Toro had some unfortunate experiences working with a demanding Hollywood studio on _Mimic (1997)_ (qv), and returned to Mexico to form his own production company, The Tequila Gang.  Next for del Toro, was _El espinazo del diablo (2001)_ (qv), a Spanish Civil War ghost story. The film was hailed by critics and audiences alike, and del Toro decided to give Hollywood another try. In 2002, he directed the 'Wesley Snipes' (qv) vampire sequel, _Blade II (2002)_ (qv).  On a roll, Del Toro followed up _Blade II (2002)_ (qv) with another successful comic-book inspired film, _Hellboy (2004)_ (qv), starring one of Del Toro's favorite actors, 'Ron Perlman' (qv).  Married with children, del Toro lives in Los Angeles.",

The famous scenes, like the induction with R Lee Ermey where he renames the soldiers and reshapes them into sub-human maggots, had a particular impact on me. Also the suicide scene with Vincent D'Onofrio in the bathroom. And the sniper set-piece at the end. Those are absolutely virtuoso pieces of filmmaking.",

                "info": "A talented actor, comedian and writer, Seth Rogen has come a long way from doing stand-up comedy as a teen. Rogen was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, to Mark and Sandy Rogen. He attended Vancouver Talmud Torah Elementary School and Point Grey Secondary School (although he dropped out of high school to move to Los Angeles) and was known for the stand-up comedy he performed at Camp Miriam, a Habonim Dror camp. At 16, Rogan came in second place in the 1998 Vancouver Amateur Comedy Contest.  Soon after that win he landed his first role in 'Judd Apatow' (qv)'s short-lived but well regarded TV series _\"Freaks and Geeks\" (1999)_ (qv), taking on the role of Ken Miller. Though the show only lasted one season, it was the launching pad for many careers, including Rogen, Apatow, 'James Franco' (qv), and 'Jason Segel' (qv). This early work sharpened Rogen's keen improvisational skills, which he's used on many projects since.  Following _\"Freaks and Geeks\" (1999)_ (qv), he participated in a few unsuccessful television projects, and then joined the American television version of _\"Da Ali G Show\" (2003)_ (qv) as a writer during its second and last season, along with his childhood friend and writing partner 'Evan Goldberg (I)' (qv). The writing team received an Emmy nomination. As a huge fan of the first season, Rogen was thrilled to get the chance to work with 'Sacha Baron Cohen' (qv).  Continuing his work with Apatow, he joined the cast of Apatow's debut film _The 40 Year Old Virgin (2005)_ (qv) and is credited as co-producer. After that he took the lead in _Knocked Up (2007)_ (qv), Apatow's second movie and a huge success. He's since been a frequent collaborator with Apatow, in projects such as _Superbad (2007)_ (qv), _Pineapple Express (2008)_ (qv) and _Funny People (2009)_ (qv). He co-wrote _Superbad (2007)_ (qv), with Goldberg; the pair started the project when they were teens. They won the Canadian Comedy Award for Best Writing in a Film in 2008. They later wrote _Pineapple Express (2008)_ (qv) and _The Green Hornet (2011)_ (qv), also starring Rogen.  A talented voice artist, Rogen is in the animated films _Horton Hears a Who! (2008)_ (qv), _Kung Fu Panda (2008)_ (qv), and _Monsters vs Aliens (2009)_ (qv), and has voiced characters for _\"The Simpsons\" (1989)_ (qv) and _\"American Dad!\" (2005)_ (qv).  Rogen was named the Canadian Comedy Person of the Year by the Canadian Comedy Awards in both 2008 and 2009.  Rogen lives in Los Angeles with 'Lauren Miller (I)' (qv), whom he met in 2004. They became engaged in September 2010 and married in October 2011.",

                "info": "Angelina Jolie is an Oscar-winning actress who has become popular by taking on the title role in the \"Lara Croft\" series of blockbuster movies. Off-screen, Jolie has become prominently involved in international charity projects, especially those involving refugees. She often appears on many \"most beautiful women\" lists, and she has a personal life that is avidly covered by the tabloid press. In her earliest years, Angelina began absorbing the acting craft from her parents - her father is the Oscar-winning actor 'Jon Voight' (qv) and her mother is 'Marcheline Bertrand' (qv), who had studied with 'Lee Strasberg' (qv). At age 11, Angelina began studying at the 'Lee Strasberg' (qv) Theatre Institute, where she was seen in several stage productions. She undertook some film studies at New York University and later joined the renowned Met Theatre Group in Los Angeles. At age 16, she took up a career in modeling and appeared in some music videos. Her exotic good looks may derive from her mixed ancestry which is Slovak, French-Canadian, Iroquois and English.  In the mid-1990s, Jolie appeared in various small films where she got good notices, including _Hackers (1995)_ (qv) and _Foxfire (1996)_ (qv). Her critical acclaim increased when she played strong roles in the made-for-TV movies _True Women (1997) (TV)_ (qv), and in _George Wallace (1997) (TV)_ (qv) which won her a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy nomination. Jolie's acclaim increased even further when she played the lead role in the HBO production _Gia (1998) (TV)_ (qv). This was the true life story of supermodel 'Gia Carangi' (qv), a sensitive wild child who was both brazen and needy and who had a difficult time handling professional success and the deaths of people who were close to her. Carangi became involved with drugs and because of her needle-using habits she became, at the tender age of 26, one of the first celebrities to die of AIDS. Jolie's performance in _Gia (1998) (TV)_ (qv) again garnered a Golden Globe Award and another Emmy nomination, and she additionally earned a SAG Award.  Angelina got a major break in 1999 when she won a leading role in the successful feature _The Bone Collector (1999)_ (qv), starring alongside 'Denzel Washington (I)' (qv). In that same year, Jolie gave a tour de force performance in _Girl, Interrupted (1999)_ (qv) playing opposite 'Winona Ryder' (qv). The movie was a true story of women who spent time in a psychiatric hospital. Jolie's role was reminiscent of 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv)'s character in _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)_ (qv), the role which won Nicholson his first Oscar. Unlike \"Cuckoo\", \"Girl\" was a small film that received mixed reviews and barely made money at the box office. But when it came time to give out awards, Jolie won the triple crown -- \"Girl\" propelled her to win the Golden Globe Award, the SAG Award and the Academy Award for best leading actress in a supporting role.  With her new-found prominence, Jolie began to get in-depth attention from the press. Numerous aspects of her controversial personal life became news. At her wedding to her _Hackers (1995)_ (qv) co-star 'Jonny Lee Miller' (qv), she had displayed her husband's name on the back of her shirt painted in her own blood. Jolie and Miller divorced, and in 2000, she married her _Pushing Tin (1999)_ (qv) co-star 'Billy Bob Thornton' (qv). Jolie had become the fifth wife of a man twenty years her senior. During her marriage to Thornton, the spouses each wore a vial of the other's blood around their necks. That marriage came apart in 2002 and ended in divorce. In addition, Jolie was estranged from her famous father, 'Jon Voight' (qv).  In 2000, Jolie was asked to star in _Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)_ (qv). At first, she expressed disinterest, but then decided that the required training for the athletic role was intriguing. The Croft character was drawn from a popular video game. Lara Croft was a female cross between Indiana Jones and James Bond. When the film was released, critics were unimpressed with the final product, but critical acclaim wasn't the point of the movie. The public paid $275 million for theater tickets to see a buffed up Jolie portray the adventuresome Lara Croft. Jolie's father 'Jon Voight' (qv) appeared in \"Croft\", and during filming there was a brief rapprochement between father and daughter.  One of the Croft movie's filming locations was Cambodia. While there, Jolie witnessed the natural beauty, culture and poverty of that country. She considered this an eye opening experience, and so began the humanitarian chapter of her life. Jolie began visiting refugee camps around the world and came to be formally appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Some of her experiences were written and published in her popular book \"Notes from My Travels\" whose profits go to UNHCR.  Jolie has stated that she now plans to spend most of her time in humanitarian efforts, to be financed by her actress salary. She devotes one third of her income to savings, one third to living expenses and one third to charity. In 2002, Angelina adopted a Cambodian refugee boy named Maddox, and in 2005, adopted an Ethiopian refugee girl named Zahara. Jolie's dramatic feature film _Beyond Borders (2003)_ (qv) parallels some of her real life humanitarian experiences although, despite the inclusion of a romance between two westerners, many of the movie's images were too depressingly realistic -- the film was not popular among critics or at the box office.  In 2004, Jolie began filming _Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005)_ (qv) with co-star 'Brad Pitt' (qv). The film became a major box office success. There were rumors that Pitt and Jolie had an affair while filming \"Smith\". Jolie insisted that because her mother had been hurt by adultery, she herself could never participate in an affair with a married man, therefore there had been no affair with Pitt at that time. Nonetheless, Pitt separated from his wife 'Jennifer Aniston' (qv) in January 2005 and, in the months that followed, he was frequently seen in public with Jolie, apparently as a couple. Pitt's divorce was finalized later in 2005.  Jolie and Pitt announced in early 2006 that they would have a child together, and Jolie gave birth to daughter Shiloh that May. They also adopted a three-year-old Vietnamese boy named Pax. The couple continues to pursue movie and humanitarian projects.",

                "info": "Born to immigrants in Queens, New York, Lucy Liu has always tried to balance an interest in her cultural heritage with a desire to move beyond a strictly Asian-American experience. Lucy's mother is from Beijing, and her father is from Shanghai. Once relegated to \"ethnic\" parts, the energetic actress is finally earning her stripes as an across-the-board leading lady.  Liu graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1986 and enrolled in New York University; discouraged by the \"dark and sarcastic\" atmosphere of NYU, however, she transferred to the University of Michigan after her freshman year. She graduated from UM with a degree in Chinese Language and Culture, managing to squeeze in some additional training in dance, voice, fine arts, and acting. During her senior year, Liu auditioned for a small part in a production of Alice in Wonderland and walked away with the lead; encouraged by the experience, she decided to take the plunge into professional acting. She moved to Los Angeles and split her time between auditions and food service day jobs, eventually scoring a guest appearance as a waitress on _\"Beverly Hills, 90210\" (1990)_ (qv). That performance led to more walk-on parts in shows like _\"NYPD Blue\" (1993)_ (qv), _\"ER\" (1994)_ (qv), and _\"The X Files\" (1993)_ (qv). In 1996, she was cast as an ambitious college student on Rhea Perlman's ephemeral sitcom _\"Pearl\" (1996)_ (qv).  Liu first appeared on the big screen as an ex-girlfriend in _Jerry Maguire (1996)_ (qv) (she had previously filmed a scene in the indie _Bang (1995)_ (qv), but it was shelved for two years). She then waded through a series of supporting parts in small films before landing her big break on _\"Ally McBeal\" (1997)_ (qv). Liu initially auditioned for the role of Nelle Porter, which went to 'Portia de Rossi' (qv), but writer-producer 'David E. Kelley (I)' (qv) was so impressed with her that he promised to write a part for her in an upcoming episode. The part turned out to be that of growling, ill-tempered lawyer Ling Woo, which Liu filled with such aplomb that she was signed on as a regular cast member.  The \"Ally\" win gave Liu's film career a much-needed boost--in 1999, she was cast as a dominatrix in the 'Mel Gibson (I)' (qv) action flick _Payback (1999/I)_ (qv), and as a hitchhiker in the ill-received boxing saga _Play It to the Bone (1999)_ (qv). The next year brought even larger roles: first as the kidnapped Princess Pei Pei in 'Jackie Chan (I)' (qv)'s western _Shanghai Noon (2000)_ (qv), then as one-third of the comely crime-fighting trio in _Charlie's Angels (2000)_ (qv).  When she's not hissing at clients or throwing well-coiffed punches, Liu keeps busy with an eclectic mix of off-screen hobbies. She practices the martial art of Kali-Eskrima-Silat (knife-and-stick fighting), skis, rock climbs, rides horses, and plays the accordion. In 1993 she exhibited a collection of multimedia art pieces at the Cast Iron Gallery in SoHo (New York), after which she won a grant to study and create art in China. Her hectic schedule doesn't leave much time for romantic intrigue, but Liu says she prefers to keep that side of her life uncluttered.",

                "info": "Born in London while his parents were living overseas, Alexander Emmert moved to the United States as a young man. A short music career preceded his academic exploits at the University of Oregon and Harvard, after which he began a lucrative tenure as an Executive Recruiter in New York until one of his early loves in life, performing, drew him away from the corporate world.  Mr. Emmert has performed on stage and in numerous independent and studio films, as well as in television series and specials. He is a Big Four repped screenwriter and independent film producer. Emmert also served as Program Director for Encore Entertainment's Creative Theatre Group Summer Camps for Film and Theatre in 2003, prior to incorporating Invictus Films in 2004. He has directed several music videos (most recently for The Replacements/Soul Asylum/Guns N Roses bassist Tommy Stinson), and written and produced numerous historical documentaries for cable television.  Alexander Emmert wrote, produced and directed \"The Judas Kiss\", which was the Grande Premiere Event at the Monaco International Festival of Film; co-produced and directed \"Between Us, Love\", which is headlining the Urban World 2010 Festival in New York City, and was Assistant Producer and Assistant Director of \"Elle: A Modern Cinderella Tale\", which won Best Family Feature at the Newport Beach Films Festival in 2010.  While continuing to perform in front of the camera and on the stage, Mr. Emmert's producing and screenwriting career have taken flight. He works on both US coasts and in Europe, and is hopeful of expanding Invictus Films' coproductions into Asia and Australia in 2011 and beyond. He lives with his dog Raja in both Los Angeles and Philadelphia at varying times of year.",

                "info": "James Duval was born in the Midwest then, in 1970, moved with his family to Alaska by driving the Alcan Highway through Canada in a station wagon with fourteen people. He was raised in Fairbanks where he spent most of his younger years reading, writing and playing the violin. After graduating high school, he spent a year and half working with the Spanish speaking community of East Los Angeles, as a volunteer for the LDS Church.  James has been driven by the desire to create for as long as his parents can remember. From theater, road shows, writing and music he has spent most of his life being a creator and encouraging others to do the same.  In 1991 he moved to San Francisco to make movies. While at San Francisco State, he met Mark Lillig and the two of them decided to step away from a film education and into the actual practice of making movies. In 1996, they formed Independent Image Entertainment (IIE) with Tyler Ross and Richard Scott.  In 2004, after working on a project entitled Wrestling Days, two young filmmakers Danny Torres and Scott Hayman joined the IIE team. In late 2005 James Duval, Danny Torres, Scott Hayman, Mark R. Lillig, Tyler Ross and Richard Scott formed Continuum Pictures in Los Angeles.  Since the formation of Continuum Pictures, James Duval has produced many features, including Mano a Mano, Three Bad Men, Convict, The Absents, and others here in the US and internationally.  Through his experiences in life, James has been given the patience, time and opportunity to fall in love with movies and the people who make them while always giving credit to those films and people who inspired him.",

                "info": "Danny Torres  Though too young to be part of the \"Jaw's Baby\" generation of filmmakers, Danny Torres grew up still highly influenced by the films of Steven Spielberg, and considers himself part of the new generation of \"Jurassic Park Baby\" filmmakers. Born in Los Angeles, California to Salvadoran immigrants, Danny attended Loyola High School while still finding time to go to the movies every weekend with his father. Upon graduating, Danny moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to attend the University of California at Berkeley.  At the age of twenty, while still in college, Danny began working as a PA on a production with the indie film company Independent Image Entertainment (IIE). Approximately two weeks into production, based on the level of work and effort Danny was contributing to the production, the partners of IIE decided to make him a producer on the project and formally invited him to join the company. By the end of that year, Danny was voted in as the head of IIE by its nine partners, most of which were above the age of twenty-five. The following year, Danny supervised the release of all of IIE's productions and produced two more features by the time he graduated college.  At the beginning of 2006, Danny moved back to Los Angeles, along with six partners from IIE and formed a new company called Continuum Pictures, whose purpose was to produce studio-level projects. Since then, Danny has directly worked on numerous feature films, award-winning short films, and music videos. Danny's filmmaking experiences during that time have ranged from handling preproduction as a producer to being on set as a writer/director; he even became Continuum Pictures' most coveted cinematographer. Once the camera stops rolling, Danny often times finds himself in the editing room, either cutting a feature himself or assisting other editors in polishing their final edits.  As a writer, Danny has written three feature screenplays and worked as a script-doctor on numerous scripts, most of which have been green-lit based on his contributions.  Danny is now regularly consulted and has been instrumental in the formation of several smaller production companies, including Filmplane Entertainment. He strives to make every project begin with an \"A\" level script, no matter its genre or budget. A driven filmmaker, Danny's goal is to make the highest quality films for the widest audience possible.",

His ability to work in a wide variety of genres, and his collaborative work sense, has made him a top choice among producers and directors. His classical training and strong proficiency with contemporary sound allow him great flexibility and versatility as a composer.  Born in New England in 1965, Charles began writing music in the fourth grade. He released eight albums and toured, but was never content until finding his niche in the film and television industry. Charles began his scoring career after being asked to write the music for the National Geographic film, \"Miracle in the Pacific\". He then went on to write music for numerous films and television programs.  Charles is well versed in blending symphonic orchestra with world instrumentation. His principal instruments are piano, guitar and trumpet. He is also fluent with indigenous flute techniques associated with Japanese Raku, American Indian and Peruvian.

                "info": "Francesco Quinn was born into Hollywood as the son of the legendary 'Anthony Quinn (I)' (qv). It has been a blessing and a curse, perhaps, to have such a famous father, but Francesco Quinn has maintained his own image on the screen in both television and movies.  Born in Rome, Italy, to 'Anthony Quinn (I)' (qv) and 'Jolanda Addolori' (qv) (whose career was also in the movie business), the path that Francesco took into the film industry would forever be shadowed by his parents' success. His father had acted alongside the greatest actors of the time, and had himself won two Oscars. He had been in over two hundred films, including such classics as _Lawrence of Arabia (1962)_ (qv), _Lust for Life (1956)_ (qv), and _Attila (1954)_ (qv). Francesco acted alongside his father a number of times in his career, including a film for television based on the best-selling novel \"The Old Man and the Sea\", when he played a younger version of Anthony's character.  Francesco's first appearance on the screen was as Marcus Vinicius in the dramatic series _\"Quo Vadis?\" (1985)_ (qv) which starred renowned European actor 'Klaus Maria Brandauer' (qv) and character actor 'Max von Sydow (I)' (qv). This was Francesco's first appearance on the screen, but the second appearance was easily his most famous and most recognized.  In 1986, a Vietnam war film called _Platoon (1986)_ (qv) directed by 'Oliver Stone (I)' (qv) starring 'Willem Dafoe' (qv), 'Tom Berenger' (qv), and 'Charlie Sheen' (qv), became a smash hit and a winner of Best Picture at the Oscars. It launched the budding careers of the director and three stars, and paved a road for other soon-to-be famous faces 'Johnny Depp' (qv), 'Forest Whitaker' (qv), and 'Keith David (II)' (qv). Francesco had a large role as Rhah, a raspy-voiced figure often in the shadows who takes heroin from dead Vietnamese and attempts to help the new recruits in their first big battle. His acting was brilliant, and his lines were memorable, yet he was passed over at the Academy Awards and any other awards.  As much of a massive success _Platoon (1986)_ (qv) was, an incident while filming gave Francesco a lot of trouble later on. In the middle of filming in the Philippines, Francesco got into a furious argument with 'Willem Dafoe' (qv), which led to fists being thrown. It gave Francesco an undeserved reputation of being a troublemaker in Hollywood, something he had to live down for a while afterwards.  After _Platoon (1986)_ (qv), Francesco acted in the TV series \"Miami Vice\", the poorly received _Love Dream (1988)_ (qv) alongside 'Diane Lane (I)' (qv), and the historical _Stradivari (1988)_ (qv) alongside his famous father. He also took a lead role in the war drama _Casablanca Express (1989)_ (qv) which also starred 'Donald Pleasence' (qv), and a number of other films in that period. None matched the success of _Platoon (1986)_ (qv), though Francesco frequently found work.  As the 90s began, Quinn reunited with his father twice, as well as taking the lead in the crime drama _Murder Blues (1991)_ (qv) alongside 'Brad Dourif (I)' (qv), the television series \"Red Shoe Diaries\" and \"Young Indiana Jones\", the action thriller _Deadly Rivals (1993)_ (qv), and the 'Chuck Norris' (qv) film _Top Dog (1995)_ (qv). Certainly a step down for Francesco, \"Top Dog\" was a flop and was negatively reviewed. However, Francesco moved onwards: he acted in the docudrama _Cannes Man (1996)_ (qv) which featured 'Johnny Depp' (qv), 'Jon Cryer' (qv), 'Benicio Del Toro' (qv), and 'Dennis Hopper' (qv) in a star-studded cast. Francesco also acted in the television film _Rough Riders (1997) (TV)_ (qv) alonside 'Sam Elliot (I)' (qv), 'Tom Berenger' (qv), and 'R. Lee Ermey' (qv).  Quinn's most famous work outside of _Platoon (1986)_ (qv) was in television, in the series \"The Young and Restless\". This began a number of appearances in well-known series, and he acted in \"The Fugitive\", \"Crossing Jordan\", and acted in the best-received episodes of the drama series \"JAG\". Francesco then played a terrorist in his most well-known appearance on television: the thriller series _\"24\" (2001)_ (qv) starring 'Kiefer Sutherland' (qv). Francesco appeared in six episodes as Syed Ali before moving on.  He returned to film, and among others, he acted in the action drama _Cut Off (2006)_ (qv) starring 'Malcolm McDowell' (qv), the poorly received 'Michael Madsen (I)' (qv) film _Afghan Knights (2007)_ (qv), the television film \"The Pledge\" starring 'Luke Perry (I)' (qv), and the 'Quentin Tarantino (I)' (qv) produced _Hell Ride (2008)_ (qv) starring 'Michael Madsen (I)' (qv), 'Dennis Hopper' (qv), 'Keith Carradine' (qv), and 'Larry Bishop' (qv). The film suited Francesco, who is an avid lover of cycling and motorbikes, though it was not a financial success.  Francesco has expanded since then to providing many voices in various video games, and has acted in a series of other small films. Amongst the upcoming films on his list is the politically themed film _Corruption.Gov (2010)_ (qv) with 'Michael Madsen (I)' (qv) and 'Joe Estevez' (qv), the Italian drama film _Roma nuda (2013)_ (qv), and the feel-good redemption film _Buttermilk Sky (2013)_ (qv) which will once again have Francesco acting alongside 'Michael Madsen (I)' (qv).  Francesco has certainly been burdened with being the son of such an acclaimed character actor as 'Anthony Quinn (I)' (qv), but he has been able to expand into various entertainment fields, yet still focus on his own personal enjoyments such as motorbiking and athletics. Certainly a long way from the rasping, bearded character who famously gave Chris a final salute at the end of _Platoon (1986)_ (qv).",

                "info": "Debbie Rochon grew up in British Columbia, Canada. She was a child of the streets and victim of much abuse until she accidentally ended up in a featured extra role in Paramount's _Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains (1982)_ (qv)!  The event changed her life, and she saved enough money to move to New York City and study acting at age 17. After many years working with numerous theater companies in off-Broadway plays, she started to land small roles in films. 'Spike Lee' (qv)'s editor 'Barry Alexander Brown' (qv) cast her in a featured role in his first directing effort, _Lonely in America (1990)_ (qv). Soon the parts grew bigger and bigger and primarily fell in the fear flick genre.  Since then Debbie has starred in dozens of horror movies and has gained cult stardom worldwide. Since 1994, she has acted in various roles in 'Lloyd Kaufman' (qv)'s Troma Productions, most notably _Tromeo and Juliet (1996)_ (qv) and _Terror Firmer (1999)_ (qv), as well as many other low-budget independent made-for-video horror flicks in lead, supporting, minor and bit parts. Although she is mostly associated with creepy features and thrillers because of her evenly-shaped, dark-haired appearance on and off camera, she has garnered acclaim for her turns in comedy and drama. She has also co-hosted a number of radio shows in New York City that focused on film and pop culture.",
