He knew early on that he wanted to be a film maker, but was held back, when his father was injured in 1976 and his mother went to work full time. Struggling to get by in southern California's turbulent market in the late 70's the family moved to Yuma Arizona in 1980. Robert began writing, encouraged by Deane Creamer-Close, a teacher, this new creative outlet became Robert's passion and he soon began to impress his teachers and friends with his stories. He also discovered a love for theater and in high school, and was active in Drama. At age 15 he performed in Tennessee Williams \"The Long Goodbye\" in the lead role. His performance got the attention of Professor of Theater and Speech at Arizona Western College, Gerald Giss. In 1991 Robert attended AWC on a full theater scholarship, and performed in more than a dozen shows over the next four years. Roles included; Bob Cratchet \"A Christmas Carol\" , Jud Fry \"Oklahoma\", Stanly Jerome \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\" and Charles Dalrimple \"Brigadoon\". After his father passed away from complications of prostate cancer in 2002, Robert determined to take his creativity to the next level. He enrolled at the Art Institute of LasVegas. Beginning in the animation program and then switching to visual effects, he achieved a B.S. Degree in Visual Effects and Motion Graphics in 2007. Returning to Yuma in 2008 to be closer to family, Robert Contacted Charles Pisaeno, and in 2010 they produced the indie suspense thriller Renovation.",

A Parsons-trained painter and artist, Chavez has lived and showed in various venues in the 5 boroughs of New York, but while looking for a solo show in Manhattan, he takes along a small video camera to record the experience of soliciting the old-fashioned way; going door-to-door. So Many Galleries puts the viewer in the shoes of the artist, condensing the reactions and advice of the gallery owners and employees into a humorous montage.",

                "info": "James Francis Cameron was born on August 16, 1954 in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada. He moved to the United States in 1971. The son of an engineer, he majored in physics at California State University but, after graduating, drove a truck to support his screenwriting ambition. He landed his first professional film job as art director, miniature-set builder, and process-projection supervisor on 'Roger Corman' (qv)'s _Battle Beyond the Stars (1980)_ (qv) and debuted as a director with _Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1981)_ (qv) the following year. In 1984, he wrote and directed _The Terminator (1984)_ (qv), a futuristic action-thriller starring 'Arnold Schwarzenegger' (qv), 'Michael Biehn' (qv) and 'Linda Hamilton (I)' (qv). It was a huge success. After this came a string of successful science-fiction action films such as _Aliens (1986)_ (qv), _The Abyss (1989)_ (qv) and _Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)_ (qv). In 1990, Cameron formed his own production company, Lightstorm Entertainment. In 1997, he wrote and directed _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), a romance epic about two young lovers from social classes who meet on board the famous ship. The movie went on to break all box office records and earned eleven Academy Awards. It became the highest grossing movie of all time. The rest is history. James Cameron is now one of the most sought-after directors in Hollywood. He was formerly married to producer 'Gale Anne Hurd' (qv), who produced several of his films. In 2000, he married actress 'Suzy Amis' (qv), who appeared in Titanic, and they have three children.",

Don't ask me where it was from... there are some things man was not meant to know. Presumably, the derelict pilot (space jockey, big dental patient, etc.) became infected en route to somewhere and set down on the barren planetoid to isolate the dangerous creatures, setting up the warning beacon as his last act. What happened to the creature that emerged from him? Ask 'Ridley Scott' (qv). As to the purpose of the Alien... I think that's clear. They're just trying to make a living, same as us.

The Queen Alien rides the elevator to follow Ripley. In _Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)_ (qv), Sara sees the T-800 for the first time exiting an elevator. The T-1000 is shot from outside the elevator and then attacks Sara, John and the T-800 above it. In another scene, Sara, John and the T-800 crash in an elevator after an explosion on a higher floor. They are then gassed by the SWAT team at the bottom. In _True Lies (1994)_ (qv), Harry enters an elevator on a horse in pursuit of a terrorist in the opposite elevator on a motorcycle. In _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), Rose goes up an elevator with Jack to escape her fiancé. In another scene, Rose goes down an elevator to a flooded floor, filling it with water.",

There were extraordinary apologists for what it could become, but I feel it hasn't become that. Cinema has been dragged down by mimetic association with all the other art forms, predominantly with the 19th century novel, and because of its distribution situation and its apparent desire to appeal to the lowest common denominator, it has gone in directions which have not fulfilled those extraordinary promises, in general terms.

                "info": "Daniel Craig, one of British theatre's most famous faces who was waiting tables as a struggling teenage actor with the NYT, went on to star as \"James Bond\" in _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv), _Quantum of Solace (2008)_ (qv) and _Skyfall (2012)_ (qv).  He was born Daniel Wroughton Craig on March 2, 1968, at 41 Liverpool Road, Chester, Cheshire, England. His father, Tim Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, then became landlord of \"Ring O' Bells\" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia Craig, was an art teacher. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel Craig was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of 6, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv)'s _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.  At the age of 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral, UK. He left Hilbre High at 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as \"Agamemnon\" in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director 'Edward Wilson (I)' (qv). He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside 'Ewan McGregor' (qv) and 'Alistair McGowan' (qv), then later 'Damian Lewis (I)' (qv) and 'Joseph Fiennes' (qv), among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of 'Colin McCormack (I)' (qv), the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named 'Ella Craig' (qv), was born in 1992. Daniel Craig made his film debut in _The Power of One (1992)_ (qv). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial _\"Our Friends in the North\" (1996)_ (qv). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in _Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)_ (qv) and _Road to Perdition (2002)_ (qv). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in _Layer Cake (2004)_ (qv), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray \"James Bond\", in October of 2005, weeks after he finished his work in _Munich (2005)_ (qv), where he co-starred with 'Eric Bana' (qv) under the directorship of 'Steven Spielberg' (qv).  Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool \"007\". He is the first blonde actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author 'Ian Fleming (I)' (qv) in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: 'Sean Connery' (qv), 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv), 'Timothy Dalton' (qv) and 'Pierce Brosnan' (qv) have indicated that Craig is a good choice as \"Bond\".",

Fleming briefly worked in the financial sector for the family bank, but just prior to the Second World War, was recruited into British Naval Intelligence where he excelled, shortly achieving the rank of Commander. When the war ended, Fleming retired to Jamaica where he built a house called \"Goldeneye,\" took up writing full-time and created the character that would make him famous -- British Secret Service agent James Bond, in a novel called \"Casino Royale.\" Fleming spent the rest of his life writing and traveling the world, but as his Bond character reached new heights of popularity on movie screens, Fleming was in ailing health. He died of a heart attack (his second) in England in August 1964 at the age of 56.",

Ben attended Samuel Whitbread Community College where his interest in theatre grew and he became a member of the Bancroft Players Youth Theatre at Hitchin's Queen Mother Theatre. During his time there he rose to prominence in many productions, most notably If This Is a Man, based on the book of the same name by 'Primo Levi' (qv), a survivor of Nazi World War II prisoner of war camp. The play was taken to the Edinburgh Festival in 1995 where it garnered five-star reviews and great critical acclaim with Ben Whishaw getting rave reviews for his portrayal of Levi. Ben then enrolled in, RADA from where he graduated in 2004 and soon landed the role of Hamlet in 'Trevor Nunn' (qv)'s 2004 production making him one of the youngest actors to portray Hamlet on-stage. Hamlet opened to rave reviews with many critics hailing Ben as the next 'Laurence Olivier' (qv) and applauding his portrayal of Hamlet with leading critics haling the birth of a star. Whishaw's film and TV credits include _Layer Cake (2004)_ (qv) and 'Christopher Morris (I)' (qv)' 2005 sitcom _\"Nathan Barley\" (2005)_ (qv), in which he played a character called Pingu. He was named \"Most Promising Newcomer\" at the 2001 British Independent Film Awards (for _My Brother Tom (2001)_ (qv)) and, in 2005, nominated as best actor in four award ceremonies for his Hamlet. He also played 'Keith Richards (II)' (qv) in the 'Stephen Woolley' (qv) biopic _Stoned (2005)_ (qv). Whishaw played in _Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (2006)_ (qv) as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, a perfume maker whose craft turns deadly getting raves once again for his stunning portrayal. Whishaw appeared in 2007's _I'm Not There (9999)_ as one of the 'Bob Dylan' (qv) reincarnations and in 2008 in _\"Criminal Justice\" (2008)_ (qv) a TV series. He appears in the forthcoming films _The Tempest (2010/I)_ (qv) and _Bright Star (2009)_ (qv).",

                "info": "She is one of the entertainment industry's most successful female producers. Barbara Broccoli was born to legendary filmmaker 'Albert R. Broccoli' (qv), affectionately known as Cubby, and 'Dana Broccoli' (qv) on June 18, 1960. Not long after, Cubby Broccoli and his new partner, 'Harry Saltzman' (qv), secured studio backing for an ambitious series of films inspired by the popular James Bond novels written by 'Ian Fleming (I)' (qv).  Ms. Broccoli grew up in the behind-the-scenes world of James Bond, traveling with her family around the world to various exotic locations. As a child, she liked to play with the photocopy machines in the offices of Eon Productions, Ltd., her father's company responsible for the Bond films. During location shooting in Japan for _You Only Live Twice (1967)_ (qv), young Barbara caught a fever from the Japanese custom of sleeping on the floor. 'Sean Connery' (qv), whose star status provided him with a comfortable bed, generously relinquished it so Barbara could properly fight her illness.  She graduated from Loyola University in Los Angeles, California with a degree in motion picture and television communications. Her first official credited job on the Bond films was for 1983's _Octopussy (1983)_ (qv) in which she served as an executive assistant. But, as with any family business, one helps out where one can. For instance, in her father's autobiography \"When The Snow Melts\", she recalls a nightmarish situation involving _A View to a Kill (1985)_ (qv) star 'Grace Jones (I)' (qv). Later, for the two 'Timothy Dalton' (qv) Bond films, she was promoted to associate producer, a post she shared with veteran Bond associate producer 'Tom Pevsner' (qv).  The August 8, 1990 issue of Variety (weekly) reported that aging Cubby Broccoli had turned control of Eon Productions Ltd. over to Barbara and her half-brother, 'Michael G. Wilson (I)' (qv) (Dana's son, who had been an invaluable help to Cubby and the Bond franchise in various capacities since the mid-1970s). Due to some unfortunate business dealings with then-MGM ownership (the studio that bankrolled Bond and held significant interest in the series), production of the Bond films was put on what would become a six year hiatus.  When the litigation was settled, \"Bond 17\" (eventually named _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv)) was on track and Barbara Broccoli, now a full producer alongside 'Michael G. Wilson (I)' (qv), was faced with the challenge of bringing Bond back to the big screen. She has earned a reputation as being tough when she has to be and for volunteering for the toughest jobs, such as overseeing the Russian location unit. _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) was a world-wide smash, and each of the succeeding Bond films were also enormously popular. This is a testament to the talent of Cubby Broccoli, who passed his knowledge of high-stakes film production on to Michael and later Barbara. The benefit of Cubby's experience is obvious when viewing the newest Bond films starring 'Pierce Brosnan' (qv).  Her non-Bond producing credits include _Crime of the Century (1996) (TV)_ (qv), which deals with the murder trial from the famous Lindberg kidnapping, and the popular London Stage production of \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\", which was co-produced by her mother 'Dana Broccoli' (qv) and half-brother 'Michael G. Wilson.' Both productions carried a personal interest for Ms. Broccoli. Charles Lindberg was her father's favorite hero, and \"Chitty\" was adapted from the film produced by her father, which was based upon the children's novel by 'Ian Fleming (I)' (qv).",

Alain spent his childhood in Switzerland, where he learned to speak French and German. In 1981, Alain and his family moved to London, where he was primarily educated. He studied history at Cambridge University (1988-1990) and completed a masters degree in philosophy at Kings College (1991-1992). In 1993, his first novel, 'Essays In Love', was published. He has since written many books on what he describes as \"the philosophy of everyday life\". His works have all been critically acclaimed, particularly his most well known non-fiction novel, 'How Proust Can Change Your Life' (1997). Alain now lives in London with his wife, Charlotte Neser, and their two young sons, Samuel and Saul. He is a regular contributer to several English newspapers, and lectures extensively on his books. He also owns his own production company, Seneca Productions, which regularly presents documentaries based on his works.",

                "info": "Born in 1965 in the Icelandic capital city of Reykjavik, the daughter of Gudmundur Gunnarsson (an electrician) and Hildur Hauksdóttir who divorced before her second birthday, Björk grew up in a hippie-type community with her mother and her seven siblings. She started to study classical music at the age of 5 and released her first album in 1977 (mainly traditional Icelandic folk songs and international hits translated to Icelandic) when she was only 11. During her teenage years Björk became involved in several bands, most of them punk: Spit & Snot (1977), Exodus (1979-80), Jam 80 (1980), Tappi Tíkarrass (1981-83) (featured the documentary _Rokk í Reykjavík (1982)_ (qv)) and Kukl (1984-86). She then formed the pop group The Sugarcubes with 'Einar Örn Benediktsson' (qv) and 'Sigtryggur Baldursson' (qv) and eventually other members 'Þór Eldon' (qv) (with whom she had a son in 1986), 'Margrét Örnólfsdóttir' (qv) and 'Bragi Ólafsson' (qv). The band released its first single in 1986 and its first album, \"Life's Too Good\", in 1988, and discovered international success, especially in UK. During her Sugarcubes years, Björk also collaborated with the Icelandic jazz group Gudmundar Ingólfssonar Trio for the album \"Gling-Glo\" in 1990, and featured 808 State's \"Ooops\", which was the start of her electronic music interest. The Sugarcubes eventually split after a few albums in 1992 and in 1993. Björk released her first solo album, \"Debut\", in collaboration with producer 'Nellee Hooper' (qv). The worldwide success of the album (nearly 3 million copies sold) made possible her second album, \"Post\", in 1995, also with help of not only Nellee Hooper but techno gurus 'Graham Massey (II)' (qv) (from 808 State), 'Howie B.' (qv) and 'Tricky (I)' (qv), followed by the remix album \"Telegram\" the year after. After some problems in the UK, where she lived, she decided to go to Spain to record her third album, \"Homogenic\", released in 1997. Her main collaborators were the 'Icelandic String Octet', 'Mark Bell (V)' (qv) (from LFO), 'Mark Stent' (qv) and again Howie B, and the album may be her most electronic. After Danish director 'Lars von Trier' (qv) discovered her in the music video of \"It's Oh So Quiet\", he asked her to play the main role and to compose the music for his new movie _Dancer in the Dark (2000)_ (qv). She won the Best Actress Prize in the Cannes Festival, and said that it would be her only cinema performance (although she'd already acted in the Icelandic movie _The Juniper Tree (1990)_ (qv)) because it was too painful for her and because she considered herself a music artist and not a cinema artist. The original soundtrack was re-worked by her before being released as an album under the title \"Selmasongs\" in September 2000 (including a new version of the duet song \"I've Seen it All\" with 'Thom Yorke' (qv)). Her fourth album, probably the most quiet, \"Vespertine\", featured a chamber orchestra, an Icelandic choir and harpist 'Zeena Parkins' (qv), and was also a successful collaboration with Matmos. She then successively released a book of photos and texts, series of DVD, a Greatest Hits album and two special boxes (\"Family Tree\" and \"Björk Box\"). She also took time to marry artist 'Matthew Barney (I)' (qv), with whom she had a daughter in 2002. In August 2004 she composed and sang \"Oceania\" for the Opening Ceremony of the Olympic Games in Athens. This song was featured on her fifth album, \"Medúlla\", released about two weeks after the ceremony. It is mostly made with vocals and some titles are close to experimental music, featuring choirs, Inuit singer 'Tanya Tagaq' (qv), Japanese artist 'Dokaka' (qv), 'Robert Wyatt (I)' (qv), 'Rahzel' (qv) and 'Mike Patton (II)' (qv), but also collaborating again with programmers Matmos, Mark Bell and Mark \"Spike\" Stent.",

From then on, he purchased and borrowed a ton of books from the local library and studied the dawn of filmmaking, until present day. Alfred Hitchcock, Iriving Thalberg, David O. Selznick, & Steven Spielberg were the first group of filmmakers he studied.  A handful of years later he would make several short films, which played at festivals, his debut independent feature film Twist Of Fate, which premiered to a crowd of 300 people, & he would write & direct a PSA Commercial against domestic violence.  In 2011, KaMeek Lucas Taitt decided to pack his bags, leaving his friends and family behind in New York & move to Los Angeles to take it to the next level.  To date, he's made his Chapter 4 Entertainment Production Company official, Directing & Executive Producing an upcoming TV pilot Makin' It, directing the short film Memories, & is getting ready to prep the remake of his Romance Epic, Twist Of Fate.",

Although the content of the project is not the most lighthearted nor socially understood of topics, KaMeek and I had such intense, insightful, in depth yet fun, goofy conversations and even across the country. This piece has been a struggle for me as an actress emotionally and without KaMeek I wouldn't have had come this far with it. Working with him has ignited my passion again for being an artist as well as my confidence and willingness to do what I love, whatever that may become.

He was extremely respectful and was a definite actor-friendly director. He really understood what an actor needed to do to make the scene work and/or make his vision come alive.

Noah started his way to stardom in commercials (in which he began to appear at age three). In 1978, he landed the role of Boxey on the cult Sci-Fi show, _\"Battlestar Galactica\" (1978)_ (qv). Later that year, he played the role of Atreyu in _Die unendliche Geschichte (1984)_ (qv) and the lead as Harry Potter Jr. in _Troll (1986)_ (qv). He taught advanced jazz and street dance in his late teens until an injury forced him to quit at 18. Afterwards, he studied Muay Thai boxing and then fought as an amateur. Noah then stayed out of the limelight until 1992 for the drama _To Die, to Sleep (1994)_ (qv).  Prior to moving back to LA in 1998, he lived in New York for two and a half years. In his spare time, he tries to get out to the track at Willow Springs, California, to race in Super Sport motorcycle racing. He has tended bar at several LA clubs and has several tattoos. He holds black belts in Tang Soo Do and Shotokan, and is currently learning American Kenpo from Dr Jerry Erickson, and he also helps him teach \"a close-quarter combat-training course for flight attendants and pilots for the airlines.\"",

Picked out at an early age for his natural singing ability, Jason quickly became an experienced and exceptional performer. Throughout his childhood and adolescence, Jason participated in countess choirs, musicals and plays throughout Maryland, D.C. and Virginia.  It wasn't until his second year at George Mason University when he started to achieve international attention. Pursued by Germany's Marlboro Music, Jason and his band \"Godhead\" signed a multi year recording contract with the company and toured Europe several times. Later signing with New York's Sol 3 Records, and then ultimately with Marilyn Manson's Posthuman Records, Jason has toured the United States and Europe many times. Fronting Godhead, Jason has shared the stage with acts such as Ozzy Osbourne, Disturbed, Rammstein, Slipknot, Static-X and Marilyn Manson.  Jason is also an accomplished songwriter, co-writing with artists such as Jeordie White (A Perfect Circle, Nine Inch Nails), Danny Saber (Black Grape), Marilyn Manson and Ben Moody (Evanescence). Jason also penned the all star collaboration \"Forever In Our Hearts,\" a song to benefit the victims of the 2004 tsunami in South Asia which included Brian McKnight, Mya, Fefe Dobson, Nate Dogg and many more. Featured in magazines such as Rolling Stone, Billboard, Guitar World and many more, Jason has also appeared on MTV, MTV2, Fuse and VH1. Touted by many critics as one of rock's best and most consistent live singers, Jason continues to wow live audiences all over the world.  In his spare time, Jason vigorously trains in Hung Gar Kung Fu and enjoys reading and thinking deep thoughts.",

                "info": "This animated fantasy film follows the adventures of a young elf boy named Dante who is destined to be king and his sworn protector, a noble warrior-turned-outlaw named Landon Wanderer. When Dante's prophecized kingship turns out to be part of a much larger and more sinister scheme, the young elf's future as king goes from being the stuff of dreams to that of an unavoidable nightmare. As events unfold, Dante begins to change into something scheming and wicked, and the hero who once swore to love and protect him now finds himself vowing to stop him at all costs. Monsters from the fantasy genre abound in the form of goblins, trolls, dwarves, elves, and more in this dark re-imagining of the age-old \"boy who would be king\" tale. While the tone is at times dark and grim, there are still precious moments of humor, humanity, and a sense of wonder at a world far more fantastic than our own.",

                "info": "Justin Murphy is a graduate of Jacksonville University and the founder of the production company Omega Theatre Productions. He began his producing and directing career on the stage with a highly successful production of Jesus Christ Superstar at the Florida Theatre in 1999, where he starred in the title role opposite Delisco, winner of E! Network's reality show The Entertainer.  His first passion has always been art and when he was only 17 he wrote, illustrated and published his first comic book series titled Southern Blood. The book received national distribution with Diamond Comics and continued to be published until Justin graduated from college in 1998.  His writing partnership with composer Roger Butterley began in 1994 when the two collaborated on concept music for the musical Eagle Song. Six years later they would complete the show and record a full symphonic recording that starred Delisco and Jamie Lynn Sigler. In 2002 Justin wrote a rock opera with Butterley called Fallen Angel and produced and directed the theatrical DVD version two years later. In 2006, Fallen Angel was accepted into the New York International Fringe Festival where it won the award for Most Outstanding Musical.  Returning to comics, Murphy wrote and illustrated \"Cleburne: A Graphic Novel\". After its publication from Rampart Press in December 2008, \"Cleburne\" went on to win the Book of the Year Award by ForeWord Magazine. The property is now in development for a film adaptation.",

Raised in London, he auditioned and earned a spot with the National Youth Theatre and later showed great promise at RADA where he portrayed the title roles in \"Macbeth\" and \"Othello.\" In 1979 he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company and stayed for approximately two years performing in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor,\" \"Cymbeline,\" \"The Three Sisters\" and \"Nicholas Nickleby.\" In the early 80s he moved into TV roles with Leigh's \"Home Sweet Home\" and later had his own drama series \"Frank Stubbs Promotes\" in 1993. With Leigh, Timothy's appeared in a number of award-winning features, particularly _Life Is Sweet (1990)_ (qv) and _Secrets & Lies (1996)_ (qv), for which he earned a BAFTA Award nomination, and the Gilbert & Sullivan biopic _Topsy-Turvy (1999)_ (qv). He also worked for noted directors 'Ken Russell (I)' (qv) in _Gothic (1986)_ (qv), 'Clint Eastwood' (qv) in _White Hunter Black Heart (1990)_ (qv), 'Bernardo Bertolucci' (qv) in _The Sheltering Sky (1990)_ (qv), and 'Kenneth Branagh' (qv) in _Hamlet (1996)_ (qv) as Rosenkrantz. A chronic illness curtailed his momentum in the mid-90s, coming back resourcefully on stage and TV. On a roll recently with more of his odd characterizations he lent his voice to the popular animated feature _Chicken Run (2000)_ (qv) and appeared in _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)_ (qv) as Peter Pettigrew, and _Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004)_ (qv) as Mr. Poe.",

He started pursuing a modeling career on his free time in the Miami Market at age 17 while in High School and then transferred his focus to commercial acting. After a few years of acquiring experience he decided it was time to move to Los Angeles to pursue a full time acting career. He was introduced to Acting and Life Coach Scott Schutzman who was a very important influence to guide him in the right direction. He began doing student films to work on his newly developed skills and soon there after was given the opportunity to work on a few low-budget independent films and co-staring in a few TV shows both in the United States and in Brasil. He recently has been cast for a few American and Brazilian productions both to be shot in Brasil. All of this experience has prepared him to whatever life has in store for him.",

                "info": "Like many Brazilian independent directors, Roberto started out working in video back in the 1980's. Video, a relatively cheap format, allowed him to experiment and develop his own style without having to be concerned with the market. After cutting his teeth in the underground, his work drew national and international attention. He directed two successful TV Series for Globo TV in Brazil, and became Artistic Director for the Cisneros TV Group in Miami. He's received many awards for his filmmaking both in Brazil and abroad.  Roberto takes much of his inspiration from fantastic and classic horror narratives. His short films bring to mind Edgar Allan Poe, Guy de Maupassant, André Gide and Caio Abreu. He specializes in using every facet of film production -- from lighting to art direction and soundtrack -- to create a signature dark style far from the mainstream.  His work has been compared to John Waters, Paul Morrissey and Pedro Almodovar. Others see reminders of the landmark style of the Brazilian production company Atlântida.  Roberto is a highly regarded acting coach who teaches acting and directing workshops throughout Brazil and abroad. He's developed several co-productions for the US Spanish language market. He is presently in pre-production on his first English-language feature film, with others in the works.  The Movie \"RGB\", was a collaboration with directors in Brazil, Thailand and Croatia produced by Unique Entertainment. The film was an Official Selection at the 2005 New York Independent Film Festival.  His most recent effort \"The Meeting\" an English-spoken short film, co-production between Brazil and US. The film was an Official Selection at Los Angeles Brazilian Film Festival 2010, LA, and at 10th DeadCenter Film Festival 2010",

Turning his aspirations to producing and directing, in 1996 he graduated from the Hollywood Film Institute with a degree in motion picture producing. In following years, he learned the art of cinematography and film editing, and later attended UCLA through the Independent Feature Project/Los Angeles, studying independent feature film financing.  In 1997, he co-directed the student short film _Lifeline Rising (1997)_ (qv), which gave him the opportunity to make his feature film debut, _Daybreak (2002)_ (qv). Made on a shoestring budget _Daybreak (2002)_ (qv), an action/thriller comprised his talents as a writer, director and producer.  Atamaniuk founded Stainless Steel Productions in 1997, as an independent motion picture production company. The company also includes Stainless Steel Interactive, established in 2006 as a digital destination for entertainment, education, reference and e-commerce for Stainless Steel Productions properties on the World Wide Web.  He also continues to take an active interest in the film community, belonging to a number of different organizations, including the esteemed American Film Institute, and Film Independent.",

                "info": "Marc began studying acting at age 6 appearing on Sigmund and the Sea Monsters. At the age of 10, Marc, joined the local Jewish Community Center workshops. His first scene was from Sweet Charity and he was hooked on musical theater. The following 8 years included continued Summer Stock musical performances, plays and founding his High Schools Drama Club. Upon acceptance into UC Irvine's Theater Department he came down with meningitis and had a brush with death. On the verge of losing his life and then beating the illness, it was goodbye college and off to the Hollywood grind. Studying with various singing, acting and dancing coaches he set out to be a triple threat. Pounding the pavements, audition after audition, bit parts, B-movies, cable movies, commercials, public service announcements, plays, musicals and tons of rejections. He began writing and decided that if anyone was going to turn him down for a part again, it would be, him. Driven by his thirst to create and produce, in 1992, he went back to school and earned his Juris Doctrate Degeree and became an Attorney so that he could earn enough money to produce the plays and films he was writing.

Since then, the ideas and stories have grown seeing the science fiction film 'Never Forget the Brave' (a cutaway from the Lost Transmission concept) filmed in 2011/12 with his largest cast and crew to date, 2 more short films linked to Lost Transmission are in development 'Vengeance of the Fallen' and the Earth based 'Terra Conflict'  In 2010, Rick's small production company went Limited in the UK, involving his wife, Ruth, who also happens to be the Catering Manager for the company.  Sometimes under scrutiny for his working ethics, Rick is adamant he will continue to treat all his cast and crew as an equal, no matter what experience level they might be at, to him everyone is valuable in making the film come to life",

                "info": "Allah Rakha Rahman was born A.S. Dileep Kumar on January 6, 1966, in Madras (now Chennai), India, to a musically affluent family. Dileep started learning the piano at the age of 4, and at the age of 9, his father passed away. Since the pressure of supporting his family fell on him, he joined 'Ilayaraja (I)' (qv)'s troupe as a keyboard player at the age of 11. He dropped out of school as a result of this and traveled all around the world with various orchestras.  He accompanied the great tabla maestro 'Zakir Hussain (I)' (qv) on a few world tours and also won a scholarship at the Trinity College of Music at Oxford University, where he studied Western classical music and obtained a degree in music. Due to some personal crisis, Dileep Kumar embraced Islam and came to be known as A.R. Rahman. In 1987, he moved to advertising, where he composed more than 300 jingles over 5 years. In 1989, he started a small studio called Panchathan Record Inn, which later developed into one of the most well-equipped and advanced sound recording studios in India.  At an advertising awards function, Rahman met one of India's most famous directors, 'Mani Ratnam' (qv). Rahman played him a few of his music samples. Mani loved them so much that he asked Rahman to compose the music for his next film, _Roja (1992)_ (qv). The rest, as they say, is history. He went on to compose several great hits for Tamil-language films before composing the score and songs for his first Hindi-language film, _Rangeela (1995)_ (qv). The enormous success of his first Hindi venture was followed by the chart-topping soundtrack albums of films such as _Bumbai (1995)_ (qv) , _Dil Se.. (1998)_ (qv), _Taal (1999)_ (qv), _Zubeidaa (2001)_ (qv), and _Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India (2001)_ (qv), which was nominated for best foreign-language film at the 2002 Academy Awards.  More recently, he worked with Sir 'Andrew Lloyd Webber' (qv) and 'Shekhar Kapur' (qv) (director of _Elizabeth (1998)_ (qv)) on a musical called \"Bombay Dreams.\" At 36 years old, A.R. Rahman has revolutionized Indian film music and one can only expect this musical genius to reach greater heights.",

Still a teenager, he sought to expand his experience, and his classical training, by leaving Mexico after he completed his training as EMT (Emergency Medical Technician at the Red Cross in Mexico), for Los Angeles City, he apprenticed in student films and theatre, before he was cast back in Portugal as a lead character in a short film \"Noite Gelada\" 2009. The ratings success of these & others projects in America led Bruno being in high demand. he has worked over the last decade in films, several Shorts, TV series, theatre productions, commercials and doing voice-overs.

                "info": "Highly inventive U.S. film director/producer/writer/actor Sam Raimi first came to the attention of film fans with the savage, yet darkly humorous, low-budget horror film, _The Evil Dead (1981)_ (qv). From his childhood, Raimi was a fan of the cinema and, before he was ten-years-old, he was out making movies with an 8mm camera. He was a devoted fan of 'The Three Stooges' (qv), so much of Raimi's film work in his teens, with good friends 'Bruce Campbell (I)' (qv) and 'Robert G. Tapert' (qv), was slapstick comedy based around what they had observed from \"Stooges\" movies.  Among the three of them, they wrote, directed, produced and edited a short horror movie titled _Within the Woods (1978)_ (qv), which was then shown to prospective investors to raise the money necessary to film _The Evil Dead (1981)_ (qv). It met with lukewarm interest in the U.S. with local distributors, so Raimi took the film to Europe, where it was much more warmly received. After it started gaining positive reviews and, more importantly, ticket sales upon its release in Europe, U.S. distributors showed renewed interest, and \"Evil Dead\" was eventually released stateside to strong box office returns. His next directorial effort was _Crimewave (1985)_ (qv), a quirky, cartoon-like effort that failed to catch fire with audiences. However, he bounced back with _Evil Dead II (1987)_ (qv), a racier and more humorous remake/sequel to the original \"Dead\" that did even better at the box office. Raimi was then given his biggest budget to date to shoot _Darkman (1990)_ (qv), a comic book-style fantasy about a scarred avenger. The film did moderate business, but Raimi's strong visual style was evident throughout the film via inventive and startling camera work that caught the attention of numerous critics.  The third chapter in the Evil Dead story beckoned, and Raimi once again directed buddy Campbell as the gritty hero \"Ash\", in the Gothic horror _Army of Darkness (1992)_ (qv). Raimi surprised fans when he took a turn away from the fantasy genre and directed 'Gene Hackman' (qv) and 'Sharon Stone (I)' (qv) in the sexy western, _The Quick and the Dead (1995)_ (qv); four years later, he took the directorial reins on _A Simple Plan (1998)_ (qv), a crime thriller about stolen money, starring 'Bill Paxton' (qv) and 'Bridget Fonda' (qv). In early 1999, he directed the baseball film, _For Love of the Game (1999)_ (qv), and, in 2000, returned to the fantasy genre with a top-flight cast in _The Gift (2000)_ (qv). In 2002, Raimi was given a real opportunity to demonstrate his dynamic visual style with the big-budget film adaptation of the 'Stan Lee (I)' (qv) comic book superhero, _Spider-Man (2002)_ (qv), and fans were not disappointed. The movie was strong in both script and effects, and was a runaway success at the box office. Of course, Raimi returned for the sequel, _Spider-Man 2 (2004)_ (qv), which surpassed the original in box-office takings.  Raimi remains one of Hollywood's most creative, exciting and intelligent filmmakers.",

Denise grew up feeling equally comfortable both in European and North American cultures and considers both Spanish and English to be her \"first languages\".  While studying piano and ballet as a child, Denise discovered early on that she had a passion for acting and at age 12 began to attend acting classes.  At age 16, she was discovered by the top modeling agency in Spain, Traffic, and quickly signed by other international agencies including Ford in NYC. She became to appear in International fashion magazines, such as Vogue, Glamour, Marie Claire and Jalouse.  In 2005, during her first summer working in Paris, Dior representatives taken by the singular beauty of her face offered her a contract for the DIOR cosmetics campaign of Spring/Summer 2006. Denise continues to model under the name Denise Sommers.  Her first break came through a role in Manolete (2008) the film starring Oscar nominated Penelope Cruz and Oscar winner Adrien Brody. The intimate scene with the two awarding winning actors served as Denise's entry into the world of celluloid.  Denise studied Acting at ESAD,(Academy of Dramatic Arts) in Madrid, and Drama and Theatre Studies at Trinity College Dublin.  While still engaged in international film productions, Denise is currently based in London working in theatre and film.  In Spring 2012 she performed in \"The Oresteia\" by Aeschylus directed by Anastasia Revi (TheatreLab Company) at Riverside Studios, London, where she caught the attention of several theatre critics.",

                "info": "Jon Lee Brody was born and raised in the Northwest Suburbs of Chicago. His father of German and Jewish decent and his mother of Korean decent, worked as a civil engineer and business consultant, respectively. Jon attended William Fremd High School where he excelled as a three sport athlete and also excelled academically. His aspirations were to be a professional athlete and like many kids in Chicago he wanted to 'be like Mike'. During high school, Jon was also a Golden Gloves boxer, an avid Martial Artist (he is a second degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do) and also was in the schools' symphony orchestra where he played the violin.  Jon went on to play football at the University of Illinois. However in his sophomore season, Jon suffered an injury that ultimately ended his playing career. He stayed in school and graduated in May of 2007 with a dual degree in Accounting and Finance. Jon was accepted for admissions to prestigious law schools like Harvard and Northwestern, but he instead chose to go against the grain and pursue his other childhood dream: acting. He didn't wait long to buy a one way ticket to Los Angeles, and since then he hasn't looked back.",

Most people don't know, but when I'm not shooting Big Time Rush, I am producing movies. In the past few years I have produced a pilot called \"Small Business\" for Comedy Central Digital, I was a producer on the Twilight spoof movie \"Breaking Wind\" for Lionsgate, and most recently I produced \"30 Nights of Paranormal Activity with the Devil Inside the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" which got distribution by 20th Century Fox. While making these films I have always run into the same problem when it comes to hiring animals. It's incredibly costly on a small budget to afford to have a dog on set, let alone a zebra. That is why I started Independent Film Animals. This company will help directors and producers get the vision that have worked so hard to achieve without going bankrupt. Our company will provide a wide range of animals for new projects. Whether you need Camels to ride in the desert, Otters to swim in your pool, Pigs to ride in your car or a Kangaroo to sit at your desk, I.F.A. will make your dreams a reality.",

                "info": "James Duval was born in the Midwest then, in 1970, moved with his family to Alaska by driving the Alcan Highway through Canada in a station wagon with fourteen people. He was raised in Fairbanks where he spent most of his younger years reading, writing and playing the violin. After graduating high school, he spent a year and half working with the Spanish speaking community of East Los Angeles, as a volunteer for the LDS Church.  James has been driven by the desire to create for as long as his parents can remember. From theater, road shows, writing and music he has spent most of his life being a creator and encouraging others to do the same.  In 1991 he moved to San Francisco to make movies. While at San Francisco State, he met Mark Lillig and the two of them decided to step away from a film education and into the actual practice of making movies. In 1996, they formed Independent Image Entertainment (IIE) with Tyler Ross and Richard Scott.  In 2004, after working on a project entitled Wrestling Days, two young filmmakers Danny Torres and Scott Hayman joined the IIE team. In late 2005 James Duval, Danny Torres, Scott Hayman, Mark R. Lillig, Tyler Ross and Richard Scott formed Continuum Pictures in Los Angeles.  Since the formation of Continuum Pictures, James Duval has produced many features, including Mano a Mano, Three Bad Men, Convict, The Absents, and others here in the US and internationally.  Through his experiences in life, James has been given the patience, time and opportunity to fall in love with movies and the people who make them while always giving credit to those films and people who inspired him.",

                "info": "Danny Torres  Though too young to be part of the \"Jaw's Baby\" generation of filmmakers, Danny Torres grew up still highly influenced by the films of Steven Spielberg, and considers himself part of the new generation of \"Jurassic Park Baby\" filmmakers. Born in Los Angeles, California to Salvadoran immigrants, Danny attended Loyola High School while still finding time to go to the movies every weekend with his father. Upon graduating, Danny moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to attend the University of California at Berkeley.  At the age of twenty, while still in college, Danny began working as a PA on a production with the indie film company Independent Image Entertainment (IIE). Approximately two weeks into production, based on the level of work and effort Danny was contributing to the production, the partners of IIE decided to make him a producer on the project and formally invited him to join the company. By the end of that year, Danny was voted in as the head of IIE by its nine partners, most of which were above the age of twenty-five. The following year, Danny supervised the release of all of IIE's productions and produced two more features by the time he graduated college.  At the beginning of 2006, Danny moved back to Los Angeles, along with six partners from IIE and formed a new company called Continuum Pictures, whose purpose was to produce studio-level projects. Since then, Danny has directly worked on numerous feature films, award-winning short films, and music videos. Danny's filmmaking experiences during that time have ranged from handling preproduction as a producer to being on set as a writer/director; he even became Continuum Pictures' most coveted cinematographer. Once the camera stops rolling, Danny often times finds himself in the editing room, either cutting a feature himself or assisting other editors in polishing their final edits.  As a writer, Danny has written three feature screenplays and worked as a script-doctor on numerous scripts, most of which have been green-lit based on his contributions.  Danny is now regularly consulted and has been instrumental in the formation of several smaller production companies, including Filmplane Entertainment. He strives to make every project begin with an \"A\" level script, no matter its genre or budget. A driven filmmaker, Danny's goal is to make the highest quality films for the widest audience possible.",

                "info": "Jay Baruchel was raised in Montreal, QC Canada. He has a younger sister who also acts. He started acting in 1995 when he made his first of three appearances on the hit show _\"Are You Afraid of the Dark?\" (1991)_ (qv). He was also in more localized shows such as _\"My Hometown\" (1996)_ (qv) and _\"Popular Mechanics for Kids\" (1997)_ (qv).  Baruchel had spent some downtime and finally got a chance to be in a classic film called _Almost Famous (2000)_ (qv) in 2000. He played \"Vic\", a devout fan of 'Led Zeppelin' (qv). 'Judd Apatow' (qv) soon had a show in the works and Baruchel played \"Steven Karp\" on _\"Undeclared\" (2001)_ (qv). He also had the chance to star alongside actors such as 'Ian Somerhalder (I)' (qv) and 'James Van Der Beek' (qv) as \"Harry\" in _The Rules of Attraction (2002)_ (qv). Things began to slow down a bit after a couple more failed shows.  Soon enough, Baruchel came back as the courageous \"Danger Barch\" in _Million Dollar Baby (2004)_ (qv). Bringing life to a role that could have been ruined so easily, Baruchel made \"Danger\" a well-loved character. The best part about this actor is his loyalty to his home country. He loves to be able to work in Canada as often as possible. He has been in many fantastic independent films such as _Fetching Cody (2005)_ (qv), _Just Buried (2007)_ (qv) and _Real Time (2008)_ (qv). All three of those films appeal to sides of a person that are never known to exist until it's too late.  He was also in many successful American comedy films. He was the lead in _She's Out of My League (2010)_ (qv) and played one of 'Seth Rogen' (qv)'s best friends (which he really is) in the movie _Knocked Up (2007)_ (qv). He's also made his mark in family-friendly films such as _How to Train Your Dragon (2010)_ (qv), playing the unlikely \"Viking Hiccup\" and also played the title role in _The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010)_ (qv) alongside his newly-found kindred spirit, actor 'Nicolas Cage' (qv).  It is no secret that while he enjoys acting, it truly is a means to an end. He is currently living his dream as he works on the hockey comedy _Goon (2011)_ (qv) and is working on many other films that are what he considers to be passion projects. Now he is making films that he has been preparing for all of his life and nothing can slow him down.",

While working as an assistant animator and layout artist for Hinton Animation Studios in Ottawa, Ontario, DeBlois simultaneously attended Sheridan College's three year Classical Animation program. Upon graduation in 1990, DeBlois was immediately hired by Don Bluth Studios in Dublin, Ireland. There, he cut his teeth as a layout artist, character designer, and storyboard assistant to Don Bluth on such films as \"Thumbelina\" and \"A Troll in Central Park.\" In 1994, DeBlois left Ireland to work for Walt Disney Feature Animation as a storyboard artist, where he soon replaced his frequent collaborator, Chris Sanders, as Head of Story on \"Mulan.\" Shortly thereafter, they re-re-teamed to create the lush and whimsical \"Lilo & Stitch,\" heralded by critics as Disney's last great hand-drawn film. Following its release in 2002, DeBlois sold several original live action feature projects to write, direct, and produce, including \"The Banshee and Finn Magee,\" \"The Lighthouse,\" and \"Sightings,\" set-up at Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Universal Studios respectively. At present, all three remain in development. 2007 unveiled DeBlois' first foray into documentary filmmaking, with the acclaimed feature length music film, \"Heima,\" chronicling the homecoming concert odyssey of Iceland's famed post-rock phenomenon, Sigur Rós. In October of 2008, DeBlois returned to feature animation to co-write and co-direct Dreamworks then-troubled \"How To Train Your Dragon,\" once again re-teaming with Sanders. The two re-envisioned the story from scratch, leading the production to its March, 2010 release, at break-neck speed. The resulting film earned Dreamworks Animation its highest critical acclaim to date and became the studio's top grossing film outside of the \"Shrek\" franchise. During this same time, DeBlois also directed another feature-length music film for Sigur Rós front-man Jónsi, entitled \"Go Quiet,\" as well as a feature length concert film entitled \"Jónsi: Live at The Wiltern.\" At present, DeBlois is writing, directing, and executive producing the highly anticipated sequel to \"How To Train Your Dragon,\" which he describes as \"the epic second act of a much larger story.\"",

His first scene was from Sweet Charity and he was hooked on musical theater. The following 8 years included continued Summer Stock musical performances, plays and founding his High Schools Drama Club. Upon acceptance into UC Irvine's Theater Department he came down with meningitis and had a brush with death. On the verge of losing his life and then beating the illness, it was goodbye college and off to the Hollywood grind. Studying with various singing, acting and dancing coaches he set out to be a triple threat. Pounding the pavements, audition after audition, bit parts, B-movies, cable movies, commercials, public service announcements, plays, musicals and tons of rejections. He began writing and decided that if anyone was going to turn him down for a part again, it would be, him. Driven by his thirst to create and produce, in 1992, he went back to school and earned his Juris Doctrate Degeree and became an Attorney so that he could earn enough money to produce the plays and films he was writing. In 1999, along with his life-long friend, Dave Cohen, they opened Res Ipsa Productions and produced the first play he wrote, Terminal. He then went on to re-write Terminal for the screen, and they produced the Award-Winning film Terminal. Marc has been nominated and won several awards for his work on Res Ipsa films, Commute, Grappling with your Demons and most recently was awarded the Golden Halo Award from the Southern California Motion Picture Council for his performance in Falling Down. Marc is in production on several projects with Ford Austin, including, Zebra Room and Guns, Hookers and a Pound of Coke",

Her big moment came when she was cast in _Journey for Margaret (1942)_ (qv). This film shot her into instant stardom and also resulted in Angela changing her name to Margaret. Throughout the 1940s Margaret was a major child star. Her unforgettable performance as \"Tootie\" in 'Vincente Minnelli' (qv)'s _Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)_ (qv) won her an Academy Award as \"Outstanding Child Actress\" of her day. She gave brilliant performances in such films as _The Canterville Ghost (1944)_ (qv), _Our Vines Have Tender Grapes (1945)_ (qv), _The Secret Garden (1949)_ (qv) and _Little Women (1949)_ (qv). By the early 1950s Margaret had made a mint for MGM and earned a personal fortune. But like most other child stars, she failed in her bid to graduate into adolescent roles and in 1951 she retired from the screen. She remained active on TV and on the dinner-theater circuit. In 1979 she began a stint as a civilian aide for Southern California to Secretary of the Army Clifford Alexander.",

Poe wrote \"The Raven\" with the intent of creating what he called an \"adult fairy tale\" and when asked why he didn't start the poem with the traditional \"Once upon a time\" but used \"Once upon a midnight dreary\" Poe replied, \"In my 'time' it's always 'midnight dreary.'\" All of Poe's stories took place at night, or if a day scene was required, it was the bleakest, foulest day of the year.",

However, some historians believe that there may have been other reasons for his untimely demise. The most common theory is that he was a victim of a political kidnapping and made to vote in a local mayoral election while dressed up in different clothes and under the influence of massive amounts of alcohol, so that he would not remember anything. Others believe that he may have had a massive brain tumor that led to a stroke; this theory is aided somewhat by the fact that Poe had a rather large, oddly-shaped head.",

Poe's symptoms and death indicate he suffered from rabies, a viral encephalitis that attacks the brain and central nervous system. Rabies -- which is transmitted from the saliva of an infected animal to the open wound of a new host -- is characterized by wide fluctuations in pulse, perspiration, delirium, coma and confusion. A patient typically seems to recover, then suffers a relapse. The clinical course of rabies is four days, after which the patient dies without treatment. These were Poe's symptoms, and his case lasted four days before he died. According to Benitez, only twice in recorded history has anyone survived rabies, and \"they weren't quite the same people they were before\" as rabies causes irrevocable brain damage. Poe kept cats, and although there is no record of his ever having been bitten, Benitez noted that only 27 percent of recent rabies victims ever remembered the bite. The incubation period can last up to a year. In Poe's time, there was no treatment for rabies, which was invariably fatal. For Poe, it was almost a case of life (and death) imitating art, an end as inevitable and as gruesome as the sufferings of his tortured characters.",

Dickens had been greatly impressed by Poe's ability to guess the ending of his 1841 serialized novel \"Barnaby Rudge\". In the \"Saturday Evening Post\" edition of May 1841, Poe had reviewed the work, which was being published serially in a magazine a chapter at a time. At the meeting, Dickens agreed to consider writing for the magazine that Poe edited, \"Graham's\", and to try to find an English publisher for Poe's \"Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque\". Nothing of substance came from either promise. Curiously, Dickens owned a pet raven named Grip, and he had introduced the loquacious raven into \"Barnaby Rudge\" as a character. In his May 1841 review, Poe commented on the use of the talking raven, saying the bird should have loomed larger in the plot. Literary experts surmise that the talking raven of \"Barnaby Rudge\" inspired Poe's most famous poem, \"The Raven\", published in 1845. After Grip died in 1841, Dickens had the bird mounted. It now resides at the Free Library on Logan Circle in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.",

                "info": "Edgar Allan Poe was born on January 19, 1809, in Boston, Massachusetts. His father, named David Poe Jr., and his mother, named Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe, were touring actors. Both parents died in 1811, and Poe became an orphan before he was 3 years old. He was adopted by John Allan, a tobacco merchant in Richmond, Virginia, and was sent to a boarding school in London, England. He later attended the University of Virginia for one year, but dropped out and ran up massive gambling debts after spending all of his tuition money. John Allan broke off Poe's engagement to his fiancée Sarah Royster. Poe was heartbroken, traumatized, and broke. He had no way out and enlisted in the army in May of 1827. At the same time Poe published his first book, \"Tamerlane and Other Poems\" (1827). In 1829, he became a West Point cadet, but was dismissed after 6 months for disobedience. By that time he published \"Al Aaraf\" (1929) and \"Poems by Edgar A. Poe\" (1831), with the funds contributed by his fellow cadets. His early poetry, though written in the manner of Lord Byron, already shows the musical effects of his verses.  Poe moved in with his widowed aunt, Maria Clemm, and her teenage daughter, Virginia Eliza Clemm, whom he married before she was 14 years old. He earned respect as a critic and writer. In his essays \"The Poetic Principle\" and \"The Philosophy of Composition,\" Poe formulated important literary theories. But his career suffered from his compulsive behavior and from alcoholism. He did produce, however, a constant flow of highly musical poems, of which \"The Raven\" (1845) and \"The Bells\" (1849) are the finest examples. Among his masterful short stories are \"Ligeia\" (1838), \"The Fall of the House of Usher\"(1839) and \"The Masque of the Red Death\". Following his own theory of creating \"a certain unique or single effect\", Poe invented the genre of the detective story. His works: \"The Murder in the Rue Morgue\" (1841) is probably the first detective story ever published.  Just when his life began to settle, Poe was devastated by the death of his wife Virginia in 1847. Two years later he returned to Richmond and resumed a relationship with his former fiancée, Sarah Royster, who, by that time, was a widow. But shortly after their happy reconciliation he was found unconscious on a street in Baltimore. Poe was taken to the Washington College Hospital where Doctor John Moran diagnosed \"lesions on the brain\" (the Doctor believed Poe was mugged). He died 4 days later, briefly coming in and out of consciousness, just to whisper his last words, \"Lord, help my poor soul.\" The real cause of his death is still unknown and his death certificate has disappeared. Poe's critic and personal enemy, named Rufus Griswold, published an insulting obituary; later he visited Poe's home and took away all of the writer's manuscripts (which he never returned), and published his \"Memoir\" of Poe, in which he forged a madman image of the writer.  The name of the woman in Poe's poem \"Annabel Lee\" was used by 'Vladimir Nabokov' (qv) in 'Lolita' as the name for Humbert's first love, Annabelle Leigh. Nabokov also used in 'Lolita' some phrases borrowed from the poem of Edgar Allan Poe. \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" was set to music by 'Claude Debussy' (qv) as an opera. 'Sergei Rachmaninoff' (qv) created a musical tribute to Poe by making his favorite poem \"The Bells\" into the eponymous Choral Symphony.",

                "info": "Geraint Wyn Davies was born in Swansea, Wales on April 20, 1957. His father is a semi-retired Welsh congregational minister and his mother, a retired teacher, who was headmistress of Geraint's first school. At the age of seven, his family moved to Canada where he attended Upper Canada College then the University of Western Ontario where he briefly studied business and economics before leaving to pursue his acting career.  Geraint was 12 when he was first bitten by the acting bug, appearing in a school production of \"Lord of the Flies\". His professional stage debut was made in 1976 in Quebec City when at 19 he appeared in \"The Fantasticks\", \"Red Emma\", and \"A Midsummer's Night Dream\". After Quebec, Geraint moved on England where he played the lead in \"The Last Englishman\". He then spent 2 seasons with Wales' leading theatre company, Theatre Clwyd, touring the United Kingdom in \"Enemy of the People\" and \"Hamlet\". It was his performance in \"Hamlet\" that led to the Regional Theatre Best Actor Award. He then spent a season with the Chichester Festival doing \"Henry VIII\". He has performed at the Shaw Festival and the Stratford Festival of Canada as well as the Mark Taper Forum, Lincoln Center. He has appeared in such plays as \"The Music Cure\", \"Candida\", \"Cyrano de Bergerac\", \"The Vortex\", \"Goodnight Disgrace\", \"Henry V\" and \"The Three Musketeers, \"The Boys from Syracuse, \"Sleuth\" and \"The Taming of The Shrew\", \"Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde\", \"My Fair Lady\" and \"King Lear\". In August of '99, Geraint starred in a one man show written by the late Leon Pownall called \"An Evening with Dylan Thomas\" at the Atlantic Theatre Festival in Nova Scotia, Canada. Two more shows were written for Geraint \"Dylan Thomas and Shakespeare: In the Envy Of Some Greatness\" and \"Stranger in Paradise\". Geraint has continued to perform \"Do Not Go Gentle\" in Chicago, Stratford and New York. Most recently Geraint appeared at Washington DC's Shakespeare Theater in \"Cyrano\" (Helen Hayes Award winner), \"Love's Labor's Lost\" (Helen Hayes Award nominee) and \"Richard III\". He, along with friend Brent Carver, are opening in Toronto's CanStage production of \"The Elephant Man\" in mid-October of 2007.  Geraint's directorial accomplishments include multiple episodes of \"Forever Knight\", \"Black Harbour\", \"Pit Pony\", \"Power Play\" and \"North of 60\". In June 2000, Geraint took on the challenge of directing Oliver Mayer's \"Joy of the Desolate\" in Highland Park, Illinois. A \"back-burner\" project for Geraint is \"Horatio Salt\", a collection of four short films that he is producing and directing.  Geraint's musical talent was first brought to prominence on \"Forever Knight\" where he actually played the piano in the loft and co-wrote a song for the \"Baby Baby\" episode. As a result he was featured in one of the selections on the first \"Forever Knight\" CD. He is a self-taught musician who produced a CD of his own works \"Bar Talk\" which is sold through his fan club with the proceeds going to a variety of charities such as Childrens' Hospital Foundation in Washington D.C. and The Stratford Festival's Shakespeare School (Stratford, Ontario). Geraint's voice can be enjoyed on two audio books, \"Great American Suspense: Five Unabridged Classics\" and \"Great Classic Hauntings: Six Unabridged Stories\".  Geraint is divorced from artist Alana Guinn however they are the proud parents of a son, Galen, and a daughter, Pyper.  He became a U.S. citizen on June 13, 2006, at a swearing-in ceremony at the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. He was made a city resident for the run of \"Love's Labor's Lost\" to facilitate the process. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg presided over his induction ceremony.",

In 1990, he became only the second animator and ninth employee to join Pixar Animation Studios.  Stanton went on to help establish Pixar as one of the world's leading animation studios. He was designer and writer on _Toy Story (1995)_ (qv), for which he was nominated for an Oscar. He went on to write and direct such worldwide hits as _A Bug's Life (1998)_ (qv), _Finding Nemo (2003)_ (qv) and _WALL·E (2008)_ (qv), the latter two both winning Oscars for Best Animated Feature. Stanton also dabbles in voice work, perhaps most memorably as Crush, the laid back turtle, in _Finding Nemo (2003)_ (qv).",

I'm a family man, I have kids, and I go to the movies. And I'm just going to make the kind of movie I want to see.

                "info": "Emmy-winning talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres was born in Metairie, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans. Her father, insurance salesman Elliot De Generes and her mother, a real-estate agent, were divorced when she was 16 years old. Her mother remarried, and her new husband, salesman Roy Gruessendorf, moved the family (which included Ellen's brother) to Atlanta, Texas.  After graduating from Atlanta High School in 1976, Ellen attended the University of New Orleans as a communication major, but she dropped out after one semester. She held a wide variety of jobs until she turned to stand-up comedy, making her bones at small clubs and coffeehouses before working her way up to emcee Clyde's Comedy Club by 1981. Her comedy was described as a distaff version of 'Bob Newhart' (qv). Beginning in the early 1980s, she toured nationally and was named the funniest person in America after winning a competition sponsored by the cable network Showtime. This led to better gigs, including her first appearance on _\"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" (1962)_ (qv) in 1986.  Though DeGeneres's early forays into series television were not successful (she appeared as a supporting player in two short-lived TV situation comedies in the period 1989-92, _\"Open House\" (1989)_ (qv) and _\"Laurie Hill\" (1992)_ (qv)), she scored a hit headlining her own 1994 sitcom on ABC \"These Friends of Mine\" (later renamed _\"Ellen\" (1994)_ (qv) after its first season). She made TV history in April 1997 when her character, and DeGeneres herself personally, revealed that she was a lesbian. However, the show was canceled the following season due to declining ratings, after which DeGeneres returned to the stand-up circuit. In 2001, DeGeneres launched a new series, _\"The Ellen Show\" (2001)_ (qv), on CBS, but it suffered from poor ratings and was canceled.  Redemption as a television artiste came in 2003, when DeGeneres's daytime talk show, _\"Ellen: The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" (2003)_ (qv) proved to be both a critical hit and a commercial success. Along with good ratings, the show has won unprecedented kudos from the industry, winning 15 Emmy Awards in its first three seasons on the air and becoming the first talk show in TV history to win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show in its first three seasons.  DeGeneres has also made a name for herself as a host of awards shows. She hosted the Grammy Awards in 1996 and 1997, as well as the Primetime Emmy Awards in 2001 and 2005. In February 2007, she had the ultimate TV awards show gig, hosting the Oscars.",

Playing a pivotal role in every aspect of his first film allowed Steven to expand his talents and move on to write and direct his second major short film, Dissonance. The ambitious award-winning drama received praise and premiered at several festivals, including a feature spot at the Utah Winter Pride Festival. Steven then expanded his range by directing a short comedy called The Mother of all Nature, which went on to win several awards at various film festivals. Steven has also composed music for several films and commercials, and has written five full length screenplays. His broad experience in film allowed Steven to work on many large studio feature films, including High School Musical 1, 2, and 3. He was also the Assistant Director on the film Adventures of Power, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Steven is currently [2009] in the pre-production phase of his first feature film, In the Belly of the Whale.",

                "info": "Stephen Edwin King was born on September 21, 1947, at the Maine General Hospital in Portland. His parents were Donald Edwin King and Ruth Pillsbury King. He was the only natural-born child in the family, his older brother David having been adopted at birth two years earlier. The Kings were the typical family until one night when Donald said he was stepping out for cigarettes and was never heard from again. Ruth took over raising the family with help from relatives. They traveled throughout many states over several years, finally moving back to Durham, Maine, in 1958.  Stephen began his actual writing career in January of 1959, when David and Stephen decided to publish their own local newspaper named \"Dave's Rag\". David bought a mimeograph machine, and they put together a paper they sold for five cents an issue. Stephen attended Lisbon High School, in Lisbon, in 1962. Collaborating with his best friend Chris Chesley in 1963, they published a collection of 18 short stories called \"People, Places, and Things--Volume I\". King's stories included \"Hotel at the End of the Road\", \"I've Got to Get Away!\", \"The Dimension Warp\", \"The Thing at the Bottom of the Well\", \"The Stranger\", \"I'm Falling\", \"The Cursed Expedition\", and \"The Other Side of the Fog.\" A year later, King's amateur press, Triad and Gaslight Books, published a two-part book titled \"The Star Invaders\".  King made his first actual published appearance in 1965 in the magazine Comics Review with his story \"I Was a Teenage Grave Robber.\" The story ran about 6,000 words in length. In 1966 he graduated from high school and took a scholarship to attend the University of Maine. Looking back on his high school days, King recalled that \"my high school career was totally undistinguished. I was not at the top of my class, nor at the bottom.\" Later that summer King began working on a novel called \"Getting It On\", about some kids who take over a classroom and try unsuccessfully to ward off the National Guard. During his first year at college, King completed his first full-length novel, \"The Long Walk.\" He submitted the novel to 'Bennett Cerf (I)' (qv)/Random House only to have it rejected. King took the rejection badly and filed the book away.  He made his first small sale--$35--with the story \"The Glass Floor\". In June 1970 King graduated from the University of Maine with a Bachelor of Science degree in English and a certificate to teach high school. King's next idea came from the poem by 'Robert Browning (I)' (qv), \"Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came.\" He found bright colored green paper in the library and began work on \"The Dark Tower\" saga, but his chronic shortage of money meant that he was unable to further pursue the novel, and it, too, was filed away. King took a job at a filling station pumping gas for the princely sum of $1.25 an hour. Soon he began to earn money for his writings by submitting his short stories to men's magazines such as Cavalier.  On January 2, 1971, he married 'Tabitha King' (qv) (born Tabitha Jane Spruce). In the fall of 1971 King took a teaching job at Hampden Academy, earning $6,400 a year. The Kings then moved to Hermon, a town west of Bangor. Stephen then began work on a short story about a teenage girl named Carietta White. After completing a few pages, he decided it was not a worthy story and crumpled the pages up and tossed them into the trash. Fortunately, Tabitha took the pages out and read them. She encouraged her husband to continue the story, which he did. In January 1973 he submitted \"Carrie\" to Doubleday. In March Doubleday bought the book. On May 12 the publisher sold the paperback rights for the novel to New American Library for $400,000. His contract called for his getting half of that sum, and he quit his teaching job to pursue writing full time. The rest, as they say, is history.  Since then King has had numerous short stories and novels published and movies made from his work. He has been called the \"Master of Horror\". His books have been translated into 33 different languages, published in over 35 different countries. There are over 300 million copies of his novels in publication. He continues to live in Bangor, Maine, with his wife, and writes out of his home.  In June 1999 King was severely injured in an accident, he was walking alongside a highway and was hit by a car, that left him in critical condition with injuries to his lung, broken ribs, a broken leg and a severely fractured hip. After three weeks of operations, he was released from the Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston.",

His father of German and Jewish decent and his mother of Korean decent, worked as a civil engineer and business consultant, respectively. Jon attended William Fremd High School where he excelled as a three sport athlete and also excelled academically. His aspirations were to be a professional athlete and like many kids in Chicago he wanted to 'be like Mike'. During high school, Jon was also a Golden Gloves boxer, an avid Martial Artist (he is a second degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do) and also was in the schools' symphony orchestra where he played the violin.  Jon went on to play football at the University of Illinois. However in his sophomore season, Jon suffered an injury that ultimately ended his playing career. He stayed in school and graduated in May of 2007 with a dual degree in Accounting and Finance. Jon was accepted for admissions to prestigious law schools like Harvard and Northwestern, but he instead chose to go against the grain and pursue his other childhood dream: acting. He didn't wait long to buy a one way ticket to Los Angeles, and since then he hasn't looked back.",

                "info": "Lester Speight is a film and television actor best known for his portrayal of Terry Tate: Office Linebacker in a series of Reebok commercials that first aired during Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003. The spots feature Speight, a former All-American Football player himself, as a linebacker charged with the no-holds barred enforcement of office policies. The commercials achieved much critical acclaim and were ranked the most watched of the Super Bowl by The Hollywood Reporter. The popular character recently made a return appearance in a series of ads campaign in support of voting. Amongst the Office Linebacker's new tackles included former Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin.  As determined and hardworking on screen as a linebacker is on the field, Speight has appeared with such stars as Eddie Murphy, Damon Wayans, Anthony Anderson, and even Optimus Prime. His television work includes a recurring role on the ABC series \"My Wife and Kids,\" as well as guest starring appearance on \"Prison Break,\" \"Bones,\" and \"Cold Case.\" On the silver screen he has appeared in hit films such as \"Transformers: Dark of the Moon,\" \"Norbit,\" and \"Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay.\"  Aside from Terry Tate however, Speight is probably most recognized by fans of the Gears of War video game series for the XBOX 360. Speight won the G-Phoria award for Best Voiceover in 2007 by the G4 Network for his performance as Augustus Cole (AKA Cole Train), a character that was modeled after Speight and includes subtle allusions to the Office Linebacker.",

After some major soul searching and a new found self-appreciation, he chronicled his thoughts and revelations through the character of Shinji Ikari in Neon Genesis Evangelion, as well as many of the other characters. Evangelion is one of the single most personal stories told in anime. The ending of episodes 25 and 26 that take place in Shinji's mind, mirror Anno's thought process near the end of his depression. Many fans who watched the show for the action were very disappointed by the psychological ending and mailed Anno many death threats (a few of which flash across the screen in End of Evangelion) who maintained that he thought the ending was perfect. At an anime convention in America, he had an interpreter and a Q & A session in which one fan expressed their disappointment. Anno took the microphone and said in straight English \"Too bad.\"",
